//! fdnb: nonblocking-mode EMULATION over blocking fd duplexes — the shared
//! layer under fd-based transport providers (pqcomm_stdio today; any future
//! fd-duplex provider reuses it instead of re-growing the pattern).
//!
//! Extracted from pqcomm_stdio per the wasm-net-seam review ledger
//! (notes/wasm-net-seam-lane.md §8) whose N1/N2 latents were MUST-FIX the
//! moment a provider's consumers could exercise the noblock arms — which the
//! P4 sim-net increment's tests are the first to do. The fixes live HERE,
//! once, with their own red-scenario tests, not per provider:
//!
//! **N1 (poll-then-BLOCKING-write)**: POLLOUT on a pipe does NOT license a
//! blocking write of an arbitrary buffer — the kernel only guarantees room
//! for a bounded amount, and a blocking write of more TRANSFERS WHAT FITS
//! AND THEN BLOCKS (pipes never return early in blocking mode). Fix:
//! [`write_noblock`] caps each post-POLLOUT write at [`NB_WRITE_CAP`] =
//! `PIPE_BUF` — the amount whose writability POLLOUT is specified to convey
//! on pipes (POSIX poll(): "Normal data may be written without blocking";
//! Linux `pipe_poll` reports writable at ≥ one page = PIPE_BUF; BSDs at
//! ≥ PIPE_BUF free). Short writes are the seam contract's normal vocabulary
//! (pqcomm::internal_flush_buffer loops; pq_flush_if_writable returns).
//!
//! **N2 (POLLNVAL/poll-error → "not ready")**: the old probe mapped a poll
//! error or a dead fd (POLLNVAL) to "no data", so a noblock read spun on
//! EWOULDBLOCK forever where the socket arm would surface EOF/error. Fix:
//! [`poll_ready`] reports READY on poll error and on POLLNVAL — falling
//! through to the actual read/write surfaces the real errno (EBADF) or EOF
//! exactly like a socket does.
//!
//! Determinism ledger: the libc::read/write (+ poll/fcntl) sites below are
//! the raw-IO surface OF fd-based transport providers, the same standing as
//! be_secure's libc::recv/send rows — they live BEHIND the §2.4 seam; the
//! sim-net provider is buffer-backed and never executes them.
