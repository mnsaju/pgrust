//! Loom models for the fdnb shared-layer duplex protocol (LOOM-BREADTH
//! inc-2 item 1: the sim-net / fd-provider reader/writer duplex, the
//! poll/write interplay that N1 fixed — see `fdnb/src/lib.rs` and
//! `notes/p4-simnet-lane.md` §4).
//!
//! Run: RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p fdnb --test loom --release
//!
//! ## What this proves (and the mirror-dialect it proves it IN)
//!
//! N1 (`write_noblock`, src/lib.rs): POLLOUT on a pipe does NOT license a
//! blocking write of an arbitrary buffer — the kernel guarantees room for
//! only a bounded amount, and an uncapped blocking write TRANSFERS WHAT FITS
//! AND THEN BLOCKS. In a *bidirectional* protocol where each peer flushes
//! before it drains (pqcomm's `internal_flush_buffer` then `pq_recvbuf`),
//! two such blocking flushes deadlock: each fills the other's buffer to
//! capacity and parks, and neither ever reaches its drain. The fix caps each
//! noblock write at `NB_WRITE_CAP` so a full/near-full buffer returns
//! promptly (short/WouldBlock) and the peer's event loop goes on to DRAIN —
//! breaking the cycle.
//!
//! Loom cannot intercept the real `libc::poll`/`libc::write` syscalls the fd
//! provider executes, so these models drive a MIRROR duplex (`Pipe` = a
//! bounded byte count under a loom `Mutex`, `Ready` = the mirror of
//! `pgsync::ParkLot`, the runtime idle-worker eventcount). The mirror is
//! FAITHFUL to the two behaviours that matter: (a) a capped noblock write
//! never parks; (b) an uncapped blocking flush parks until the whole
//! remainder fits. The determinism-lint header already rules the real
//! syscall sites behind the §2.4 seam; this is the exhaustive guard for the
//! *protocol shape* the seam implements. Mirror-dialect honesty:
//! `notes/loom-breadth-inc2.md` §1.
//!
//! Models:
//!   1. `duplex_capped_flush_no_deadlock` — two peers, each sends L>cap bytes
//!      then receives L, over two cap-C pipes, using CAPPED non-blocking
//!      writes + interleaved drains parked on the shared readiness lot. In
//!      EVERY interleaving both peers complete (loom's deadlock detector is
//!      the oracle; the lost-wakeup surface is the readiness lot).
//!   2. `duplex_readiness_wake_never_lost` — the isolated lost-wakeup pin:
//!      a peer that captured the lot epoch, found no progress, and is about
//!      to park is still woken by the other side's state change (the N2/N1
//!      "empty+writer-live ⇒ park, not spin" readiness rule).
