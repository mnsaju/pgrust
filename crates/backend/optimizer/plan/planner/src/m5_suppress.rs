//! M5-3 — coverage-keyed Gather suppression (docs/design/m5-planner.md
//! §2.3, branch m5-design-v2 @ bc18ae12c): THE one planner touch of M5
//! phase 1.
//!
//! Under `pgrust.parallel_engine = runtime`, a plan shape whose coverage-
//! matrix row is COVERED must not be handed to Gather (the runtime's
//! admission walks require "not already in parallel mode"): the planner
//! suppresses Gather/GatherMerge path generation for it, the serial-shaped
//! plan reaches the executor, and the M5-1 router engages the runtime.
//! Uncovered rows keep their Gather paths exactly as today (legacy engine
//! executes them). Under the default `legacy` engine this module is inert
//! — one cached-bool load behind call sites that already early-return when
//! no partial paths exist — and plans are byte-identical to today.
//!
//! Probe law (§2.3, risk P1): the probe is a conservative CLASS check
//! (relation AM × shape class × composition qualifiers), deliberately
//! COARSER and STRICTLY NARROWER than the executor admission walks.
//! False negatives (probe says uncovered, walk would have admitted) cost
//! only "legacy instead of runtime" — safe. False positives (probe
//! suppresses, walk then refuses) cost "serial instead of legacy-parallel"
//! — so every class below whitelists only shapes the §1.1 walk censuses
//! admit, and anything unrecognized is uncovered.
//!
//! MATRIX OF RECORD (reconciled at m5-integration): the class table below
//! is pinned against the `probe_key` column of the LIVING coverage matrix,
//! crates/backend/executor/execmain/src/lanev2/m5-coverage.tsv (the M5-1 router artifact — one file, one
//! (class × spill/topn/bytes) row-key vocabulary, asserted by the unit
//! test below; the separate bootstrap TSV is deleted). ROW-FLIP TRANCHE 1
//! (m5-integration-r2): the original seven bootstrap classes plus TWO
//! flipped rows — CbTopnBoundedIntKeys (bounded top-N, sort arm) and
//! CbHashJoinPlainAgg (plain agg over one two-pgrcolumnar-rel join, hashjoin
//! arm) — route runtime; living-matrix rows the probe cannot key at plan
//! time carry probe_key "-" and keep Gather regardless of their route_to
//! flag (the bootstrap-narrowing law — safe false negatives, upgraded per
//! class in future M5-3 row-flip increments with review + measurements).
//! Per-class measured comparisons: scripts/m5-rowflip-measure-e2e.sh (the
//! §4.4 vehicle; ledger rows in the lane notes).
//!
//! Kill switches / gates (outermost first):
//!   * `pgrust.parallel_engine` unset/`legacy` (the default) — inert.
//!   * `PGRUST_M5_SUPPRESS=0|off` — suppression's own kill, engine GUC
//!     untouched (guc_tables::parallel_engine).
//!   * `PGRUST_RUNTIME=1` + `pgrust.lane_executor` required, else the
//!     engine degrades to legacy loud-once (§2.2 — never suppress a
//!     Gather the runtime cannot pick up).
//!   * `PGRUST_M5_GROUPBY_HIGH_FLOOR=<ngroups>` — the groupby_high
//!     legacy-hold boundary (§10 default taken: groupby_high stays legacy
//!     until parity), default 4e6 estimated groups (raised from 1e6,
//!     night/routing-floor-fixes; setting 1000000 restores the old bound).
//!   * `PGRUST_M5_SUPPRESS_TRACE=1` — one stderr line per suppressed
//!     query (class, rel OID, group estimate) for the refusal-rate
//!     reports.

// width from dop 8 up (the banked ladder, scratchpad/night/
// nlx-ab-fleet-full.tsv) — but a census-shape query never reaches it: the
// planner elects GATHER parallel-NL (small filtered driver rel, inner index
// probes into a big fact), which the arm fail-closed refuses. This probe
// suppresses Gather for exactly that family so the serial NL plan survives
// to the executor, where the arm re-classifies and engages at the routed
// dop (router::arm_dop(ArmClass::NlIndex) → pgrust.runtime_dop).
//
// SUPPRESS-THEN-SERIAL LAW, ELECTION-EXACT: suppression is admitted only

// NestPath(INNER, outer = heap SeqScan, inner = parameterized btree
// IndexPath) — checked at the rel-aware choke points where that path
// exists (generate_useful_gather_paths + create_partial_grouping_paths).
// No stats-shaped election prediction: the planner's own serial election
// is the guard (a smoke round proved margin/pages heuristics suppress
// into serial hash joins). If serial-NL won the serial election, the
// morsel arm at dop>=8 dominates every Gather form the suppression
// removes (parallel-X >= serial-X/dop >= serial-NL/dop ~ the arm; the

// SE-T2AGG (night/tier2-agg-cars): three tier-2 coverage cars, ONE fenced
// block (sibling probe lanes add their own blocks — keep this region
// contiguous; the classify_covered call sites are one-liner delegations).
//
//   CAR A  distinct-plain-shape (`classify_distinct_plain`): plain
//          `SELECT DISTINCT col` plans HashAggregate (AGG_HASHED, zero
//          aggregates), which no runtime sink admitted — the m5-integration
//          r2 suppress-then-refuse false positive re-keyed the bootstrap
//          class away and left the shape UNKEYED (matrix row
//          distinct-plain-shape). The runtime PLAIN-distinct sink's kernels
//          already collect int + canonical-bytes text distinct VALUES
//          (plainpd.rs — the distinct-text-date-args admission note); the
//          new executor sub-arm (runtime_plaindistinct.rs
//          `try_own_plain_selectdistinct_runtime`) reuses that pipeline and
//          adopts the merged set as emit rows. Knob:
//          `PGRUST_LANE_V2_DISTINCT_PLAINSHAPE` (default OFF; ON iff `1|on`),
//          same spelling read by the executor sub-arm (knob-coherence law),
//          plus the engine-car kill `PGRUST_RUNTIME_PLAINDISTINCT` mirrored
//          here (a keyed shape whose arm is disarmed would land on serial).
//          COMPOSITION NOTE (assembly): night/subquery-admission lands the
//          SERIAL half of the same gap (zero-transition grouping in the
//          lane, `PGRUST_LANE_V2_GROUPONLY`) — the halves compose: this
//          probe only suppresses the Gather; a runtime sub-arm refusal
//          falls to whatever serial arm owns the shape (theirs once landed
//          — strictly better than the per-row breaker), never a
//          conflicting route.
//
//   CAR B  gap:agg-min-text (`grouped_str_minmax_arg`): the single-text-key
//          grouped agg with MIN(URL)/MIN(Title) — GROUPED_SINK_AGGS is
//          int-only and the runtime agg sink's spec derivation
//          (sink_resolve_combines) refused text min/max. The sink gains a
//          knob-gated VarlenaMinMax vocabulary entry (nodeagg sink.rs;
//          canonical-bytes survivor, memcmp-tier collations only, the
//          merge.rs VarlenaMinMax kernel mirrored); this probe admits
//          min/max(text) PASSENGERS under the SAME spelling
//          (`PGRUST_LANE_V2_AGG_STRMINMAX`, default OFF; ON iff `1|on`).
//          Fail-closed: default-collation (OID 100) bare text Vars only —
//          the only collation the probe recognizes as deterministic; the
//          engine's `str_collation_safe` is the stricter runtime twin.
//
//   CAR C  gap:agg-orderby-nolimit (`full_sort` composition): the unbounded
//          grouped agg + `ORDER BY count(*)` with NO LIMIT — the topn arm's
//          `limitCount.is_some()` binding left the shape on the final
//          `Ok(false)`. The suppressed serial plan is `Sort <- HashAgg <-
//          SeqScan` (or `Sort <- Agg(SORTED) <- Sort <- SeqScan` for the
//          count(DISTINCT) class): the runtime sinks already engage with the
//          Agg below a Sort root (the reduced-exprkey decorated-root precedent), the
//          unbounded `sink_topn_arm` declines into the plain full drain, and
//          the REAL serial Sort above orders the finalized groups — the
//          decorated-root pattern WITHOUT the bound; no executor change.
//          Knob: `PGRUST_LANE_V2_AGG_SORT_NOLIMIT` (DEFAULT ON since t36
//          flips2, GL-T2B; `=0|off` kills). NOTE for assembly: the
//          decorated-root generalization lane's CAR 1
//          generalizes root decoration — this is the agg-specific narrow
//          case behind its own switch; unify at merge if theirs subsumes.
//
// All three are knob-path finishes (finish_knob_path) — NOT BOOTSTRAP_MATRIX
// classes, so the drift guards are untouched; a thrown kill (or the two
// still-gated cars' default OFF) takes the identical pre-car refusal
// byte-for-byte. t36 flips2 dispositions per the GL-T2 letters: CARs A
