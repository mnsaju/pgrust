//! The SERIAL-SIDE cost term — step-2 three-way shadow arbitration
//! (runtime-cost-model design §2 "serial-side term" / §5 step 2).
//!
//! `runtime_model` prices runtime-vs-Gather; it carries NO term for the
//! serial lane's advantages — the early-exit/zone-skip machinery (zone
//! maps, best-first bound tightening, shared-cutoff granule skip, footer
//! META answers) that makes the serial lane the measured BEST engine on
//! three witnessed shape families, each hand-fenced today instead of
//! priced:
//!   * the selective-qual datetime-lead bounded top-N carve
//!     (m5_suppress `TOPN_NONINT_MIN_QUAL_SURVIVAL`),
//!   * the truncated-timestamp grouped-fold page fence
//!     (m5_suppress `tstrunc_max_pages`),
//!   * the unqualed wide-tlist bounded top-N residual (the serial
//!     zone-adaptive walk beats the engaged runtime arm at the full
//!     scale; named in the topn-nonint letter, un-fenced).
//!
//! WHAT MAKES SERIAL FAST, as a model: the walk's cost is granules READ,
//! not rows scanned. A bounded shape's best-first walk reads a ~constant
//! granule count (`g_bf`) at survival 1 and pays `1/q` more as a qual
//! starves the bound (survivors must be found before the bound can prune);
//! zone-friendly data (sorted-bank axis) shrinks `g_bf` an order of
//! magnitude because bands are disjoint and skips are provable. Unbounded
//! folds read every granule, but a zone-PROVABLE qual downgrades a
//! granule read to a footer META answer.
//!
//! ```text
//!   g_total = N / GRANULE_ROWS
//!   t_ser   = s_setup + s_gran * g_read
//!     bounded, numeric lead:  g_read = min(g_total, g_bf(z) * (k/10) / q)
//!     bounded, text lead:     g_read = g_total   (no zone vocabulary)
//!     unbounded fold:         g_read = g_total   (META: s_meta per granule)
//!   t_par   = setup + rate * N / min(D, cap)      (per family + engine)
//!   pick    = argmin over the family's REACHABLE engines
//! ```
//!
//! Reachability is structural: on the zone-friendly posture the runtime
//! sort arm BAND-REFUSES to the serial walk (the executor's own predicate),
//! so the friendly three-way is {serial, Gather} — pricing an engine the
//! router will not run would be a fiction.
//!
//! UNITS: witnessed-wall-ms on the reference fleet rig (dist profile,
//! warm medians). Verdicts are argmin comparisons WITHIN one family, so
//! the absolute anchor cancels — the same normalization argument as
//! runtime_model's legacy-row-equivalents. The two modules' numbers are
//! NOT commensurable; nothing here feeds the two-way rt/legacy curves.
//!
//! CALIBRATION (witnessed-ab; constants of record in
//! crates/backend/optimizer/path/costsize/src/runtime-cost-constants.tsv, pinned by
//! `serial_constants_match_tsv`; fit script scripts/serial-term-fit.py):
//! * topn-nonint family: the GL-TOPNNI-1 three-way grid (10M dist job
//!   pgrust-fast-tests-8cf38a8c7c-1784631271-6af8 + the wave-3 100M dist
//!   leg @ 8cf38a8c7; per-cell serial/legacy/runtime witnesses), plus the
//!   real-sorted-bank friendly anchors (flip-sanity jobs -628/-632/-634272
//!   @ 34b23fdf2).
//! * tstrunc family: the GL-OPENROWS car-3 two-scale record (jobs
//!   -0c51/-2e14/-70ed/-66f5 @ 0ead86dcd/cd271d726).
//! * topn-selqual family (the carve flip's ENFORCING model): the
//!   GL-RESIDUAL-2 born-RED red legs' star-wide selective cells (jobs
//!   pgrust-resid-bornred-red-s{10m,100m}-… -31c8/-0156, 3 draws each)
//!   plus the green legs' stock-posture cells (-2f77/-671f).
//! * scanfold-meta family: the ladder-spec L4 named serial-dominance cell
//!   (job …-1784634348-6239 @ 45f07dd71). Single-cell anchor — the L7
//!   ladder spec owns the grid.
//!
//! SHADOW ONLY: this module decides NOTHING. The planner traces/censuses
//! the three-way pick next to the shipped carves (m5_suppress
//! serial_shadow); the carves stay until their GL flip letters ride the
