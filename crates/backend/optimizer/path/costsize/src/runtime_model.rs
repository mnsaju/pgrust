//! Step-1 runtime cost model — cost-derived engagement floors
//! (scratchpad/night/runtime-cost-model-design.md §5 step 1).
//!
//! Replaces the M5-5 FloorGuard RECTANGLES (m5_suppress::class_guard) with
//! per-class crossover CURVES fit by least squares from the EXISTING m5-5
//! ladder cells (notes/m5-5-floors.md: jobs -6b53/-0591/-4e08/-5020/-4082/
//! -6632 @ 2159563ff, dop4 x 100k..5M, + -0831/-7237/-3aa5 @ 37decba75,
//! dop8/16 @ 5M + dop16 @ 2.5M; fast-profile, medians of 5). The fit script
//! of record is scripts/runtime-cost-fit.py (deterministic, seeded); the
//! constants table of record is crates/backend/optimizer/path/costsize/src/runtime-cost-constants.tsv,
//! pinned against this module by `constants_match_tsv` below (the
//! bootstrap_matrix_matches_tsv precedent). No naked numbers: every value
//! here carries measurement sha + date + jobs in the TSV.
//!
//! CALIBRATION STATUS — WITNESSED v2 GRID (GL-COST-3, 2026-07-21): fit
//! from the M5ROWFLIP2 rows of scripts/m5-rowflip-measure-v2.sh (per-leg
//! engine pins, serial/legacy NEGATIVE witnesses, legacy Workers-Launched
//! witness, runtime dop-pinned engagement, fast-profile server) — jobs
//! pgrust-fast-tests-c517fec04e-…{-66c9,-0f09,-3ad6,-2686,-47ad,-58be,
//! -17f3,-11d5,-683a} @ night/cost-step1 c517fec04, replacing the
//! contaminated v1 record (hj-ladder-v2-and-seat-letter.md) wholesale.
//! The v2 record contradicts three shipped rectangles at witnessed cells
//! (see the disagreement pin below): those cells are the flip-gate
//! candidates, each needing its GL-COST-<class> letter before any
//! PGRUST_M5_COST_ROUTE flip. Heap-scan classes engaged at dop<DOP in
//! some cells (runtime witness dopN-MISMATCH — a scan-program item);
//! their ratios are honest "what suppression delivers" wall ratios.
//!
//! MODEL (ratio-normalized — legacy per-row work == 1 unit; verdicts are
//! ratio comparisons, so the absolute anchor cancels; step 2 rebases both
//! sides to cost units via the t34 anchor without moving any verdict):
//!
//! ```text
//!   t_rt(N, D)  = c_engage + w_row * N / D     runtime: measured
//!                                              near-linear for D <= 16
//!   t_leg(N, D) = l_setup + N / min(D, l_cap)  legacy Gather saturates
//!                                              at l_cap workers
//!   predicted_ratio(N, D) = t_rt / t_leg       (rt/legacy, the ladder's
//!                                              own unit)
//!   suppress Gather  iff  ratio <= 1.0  &&  N >= n_min_fit
//! ```
//!
//! `n_min_fit` is the smallest ENGAGED ladder row count for the class:
//! below the measured support the curve is extrapolation, and the verdict
//! fails toward the incumbent (Gather stands) — the same fail-closed
//! posture the rectangles had, now with provenance.
//!
//! What this module does NOT model (each with a named owner):
//! - HeapPlainCountStar `min_pages 8192`: an ADMISSION MIRROR of the
//!   rowdrive 64MB block floor (m5-5 reading #3), not economics — the
//!   caller must keep applying it in every mode.
//! - groupby_high HOLD (4e6): classify-time input, retired at step 2.
//! - CbMetaFooterAgg: footer answers are O(1) — never floored, no curve.
//!
//! Routing mode — `PGRUST_M5_COST_ROUTE` (design §migration):
//!   unset             DEFAULT since t36 flips2 = the THREE WITNESSED rot
//!                     cells decide by curve:
//!                     `CbPlainAggFold,CbGroupedAggTextKey,CbHashJoinPlainAgg`
//!                     (GL-COST-SCANFOLD-1 / -TEXTKEY-1 / -HASHJOIN-1, all
//!                     FLIP-RECOMMENDED — notes/gl-cost-class-flip-letters.md,

//!                     from the PlainAgg curve at GL-COST-2: their own
//!                     witnessed grids refuted the reuse (3.0-6.4x
//!                     rt/legacy) — guarded off at every size until an own
//!                     witnessed curve (m5_suppress::class_guard, TSV
//!                     rectangle_max_rows rows, kill
//!                     PGRUST_M5_HJRIDER_CURVE=1 one train).

//!   "shadow"          the KILL for the default flip: curve computed +
//!                     traced next to the floor verdict; FLOORS DECIDE
//!                     everywhere (the pre-t36 posture).
//!   "0" / "off"       fully off: no curve evaluation, no trace.
//!   "1" / "all"       curves decide every curve-modeled class (rectangle
//!                     classes keep floors).
