//! M4 background-job dispatcher (docs/design/m4-bgjobs.md §3.2/§3.3):
//! periodic daemons expressed as Maintenance-class ResourceGroups on the
//! morsel runtime instead of dedicated always-alive threads.
//!
//! One process-lifetime dispatcher thread owns every migrated job's
//! deadline and wake edge:
//! - DEADLINES: a min-scan over idle jobs' due times bounds a
//!   `waiter::park_timeout`; on expiry the job's CYCLE RG (one task set,
//!   one morsel = one daemon loop iteration) is submitted via
//!   `Runtime::submit_maintenance` (the §3.5 pick preference guarantees a
//!   start within ~one task boundary while the pool is live).
//! - LATCH WAKES: while a job is idle the dispatcher publishes ITS OWN
//!   waker handle into the job latch's `waker` word under the owner-at-
//!   wait-entry Dekker protocol (waker store → maybe_sleeping → is_set
//!   recheck — exactly waiteventset's wait_loop arm). Every existing
//!   `SetLatch` caller (StrategyNotifyBgWriter, RequestCheckpoint,
//!   async-commit wakes, thread-signal delivery) then wakes the dispatcher
//!   with NO caller change; the dispatcher converts the set latch into an
//!   immediate cycle submission. Handles are token-validated — a stale
//!   publication is a structural no-op, not a wedge.
//! - SINGLE-FLIGHT: a job never has two cycles in flight; the next
//!   deadline comes from the finished cycle's [`CycleOutcome`].
//! - WATCHDOG: an in-flight cycle that has not STARTED within
//!   `PGRUST_RUNTIME_BGJOBS_WATCHDOG_MS` (default 10s) draws a one-shot
//!   LOG self-report (the stall.rs discipline). Deliberately log-only in
//!   M4: only advisory-deadline daemons migrate (§4 disposition table).
//!
//! KILL SWITCH: `PGRUST_RUNTIME_BGJOBS=1` (default OFF), meaningful only
//! with `PGRUST_RUNTIME=1` (the pool). With the flag off this crate is
//! dead code in every production path — the increment gate is zero
//! behavior change.
//!
//! What this increment deliberately is NOT (yet): no daemon is wired (the
//! bgwriter migration is increments 3-4 — TLS extraction, then the
//! virtual-child postmaster integration + the job envelope bind). Cycle
//! bodies here run UNBOUND on pool workers; real daemon cycles run under
//! the job envelope bind, which owns ResetLatch and signal drains.
