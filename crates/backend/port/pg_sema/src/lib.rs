//! One backend = one thread, so C's cross-process PGSemaphores reduce to
//! in-process counters keyed by ProcNumber, blocking on the owner's Waiter
//! (M0 lane C): PGSemaphoreLock is only ever called by the semaphore's own
//! proc (the LWLock block point parks the waiter itself; unlockers are
//! other threads posting the count and unparking the published handle).
//!
//! Dekker discipline mirroring the latch: the locker publishes its waker
//! handle, then re-checks the count (SeqCst edges both sides), so an unlock
//! either sees the handle or the locker sees the posted count — a lost wake
//! is impossible; the waiter recheck cadence stands behind it as the debug
//! backstop, as everywhere.
//!
//! Handle lifetime = one blocked lock (C parity: a returned sem_wait leaves
//! no registered waiter). The published handle is RETIRED (waiter word -> 0)
//! when the lock consumes its count and returns: waiter handles are
//! per-incarnation (wretain warm claims reissue the token; proc slots and
//! pool threads recycle), so a handle left published across an ownership
//! epoch is stale residue — the next owner's debug_assert reads it as a
//! phantom "concurrent waiter" (the 2026-07 dev-profile wedge-legs panic),
//! and unlocks route wakes to a structurally-dead handle. PGSemaphoreReset
//! (proc acquisition, C InitProcess parity) also clears the route, covering
//! abnormal exits. Loom models: waiter/tests/loom.rs `pg_sema_*` (protocol
//! mirror over the slot core, including the epoch-reuse shape).
