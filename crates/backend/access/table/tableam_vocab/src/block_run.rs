//! W2a increment 2 — the transaction-private block-run allocator
//! (scratchpad/night/w2-worker-writes-design.md §2).
//!
//! One allocator per parallel write engagement, shared by every writing
//! participant. Each writer CLAIMS a private, disjoint run of target blocks
//! and fills it through its own `BulkInsertStateData` (the run rides the
//! existing `next_free`/`last_free` bulk-extend protocol in hio's
//! `RelationGetBufferForTuple`, so page fill/WAL logic is byte-identical to
//! the serial bulk-insert shape). No two writers ever hold the same target
//! page, by construction.
//!
//! Physical extension happens INSIDE a claim, under the allocator's own
//! mutex, through the existing bufmgr seam with `EB_SKIP_EXTENSION_LOCK`:
//! the target relation is created by THIS transaction under
//! AccessExclusiveLock, so no other backend can extend or scan it — exactly
//! the condition the skip flag encodes (hio.c's own single-caller assert
//! shape). The heavyweight relation-extension lock is never taken. The
//! extended pages are valid zeroed buffers (`smgr_zeroextend` + buffer-table
//! insert inside the seam); the consumer initializes each page at first use
//! (the `PageIsNew -> PageInit` arm hio already has for `next_free` blocks).
//!
//! Claim sizes ramp 8 -> 64 pages (doubling per claim, capped at hio's
//! `MAX_BUFFERS_TO_EXTEND_BY` parity) so small results bound the trailing
//! zero-page waste while big ones amortize the mutex to ~one acquisition per
//! 64 written pages per worker. A single mutex (not the design sketch's
//! lock-free `fetch_add`) is deliberate: claims are per-run, not per-row, so
//! contention is negligible at any supported DOP and the invariants stay
//! auditable.
//!
//! Crash story: the allocator is memory-only; every durable effect goes
//! through ordinary extend/heap-page writes into a relfilenode that dies
//! with the transaction (the standard orphan-file-after-crash-mid-CTAS
//! shape). There is nothing to recover.
