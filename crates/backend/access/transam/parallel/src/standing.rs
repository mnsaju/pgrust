//! M2 POOL BINDING — standing runtime executors (parallelism redesign
//! §2.3; notes/m2-pool-binding.md).
//!
//! The M1 runtime-scan arm launches wpool helpers PER ENGAGEMENT and pays
//! full worker launch + a double bind (parallel_worker_body's init for a
//! trivial entry task, then the query-task binder's re-bind at
//! POST_TASK_PARK) — the ~8ms fixed cost M1-a attributed. This module makes
//! the helpers STANDING: a process-lifetime gang of executor threads with
//! bgworker-shaped identity (PGPROC from a boot-reserved segment — see
//! `postinit::InitializeMaxBackends` — so the gang never consumes the
//! bgworker registry, parallel-class, or postmaster-child-slot budgets the
//! legacy arms measure against), DB-PINNED on first use (tech-debt TD-1:
//! bind/unbind is cheap WITHIN a database; cross-db engagements refuse
//! fail-closed and the leader falls back to the launched path).
//!
//! Per engagement a standing worker pays exactly: one condvar wake, one
//! lock-group join, ONE query-task-binder bind (GUC transfer = the query
//! pin's single Arc apply, which also adopts the leader's CURRENT base —
//! so a boot-captured gang GUC base can never leak stale reload state into
//! a query), the driver's executor build + pinned drive, one unbind, one
//! lock-group leave. No thread launch, no entry task, no double bind, no
//! worker-exit join.
//!
//! Parking discipline (wpool precedent, launch_backend wpool docs): workers
//! park BETWEEN engagements on a plain process-local Condvar — never on
//! shared-memory latches — so crash reinit can invalidate them with an
//! epoch bump without woken threads touching reset shared memory
//! (flush_for_crash discipline). DROP DATABASE rides the same
//! `parallel_pool_retire_db` seam wpool uses: gang workers pinned to the
//! dropped database exit (ProcKill returns the PGPROC, RemoveProcFromArray
//! clears the procarray entry CountOtherDBBackends polls).
//!
//! Thread identity is the launch_backend spawn glue's (rtgang): postmaster
//! prelude + InitPostmasterChild + InitProcess(BgWorker, boot-reserved
//! segment) + BaseInit + the synthetic bgworker entry, then
//! `gang_worker_loop` here; the glue also owns the run_child_task-shaped
//! ProcExitThread catch + deferred-callback drain (ProcKill) at exit.
//!
//! Kill-switch layering: the gang exists only under PGRUST_RUNTIME=1 (the
//! reserved PGPROC segment too), engages only for published engagements
//! (the M1 arm's own arming gates those), and PGRUST_RUNTIME_POOLBIND=0
//! disables this module entirely (leader falls back to the launched path).
//!
//! M2 inc-1: ALL runtime SQL arms use this channel — the per-arm driver
//! rides each engagement's ParallelShared (`StandingDriver`,
//! `set_standing_driver`) instead of a process-global slot; the sink arms
//! carry their own layered kill (PGRUST_RUNTIME_POOLBIND_SINKS=0, gated at
//! their call sites in execmain's standing_channel).
