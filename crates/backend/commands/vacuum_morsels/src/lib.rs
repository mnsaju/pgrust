//! vacuum_morsels — pure units for morselized VACUUM.
//!
//! inc-1 of docs/design/vacuum-morsels.md (RATIFIED 2026-07-13): the
//! VM-driven skip-map source (§3.1), the per-worker scan Locals with
//! order-free folds (§3.2), the round-quiesce protocol (§3.3, amended at
//! inc-1 — see [`QuiesceState`]), the dead-TID run merge, and the §5.2
//! coverage guard. NO executor wiring, NO buffer access: every unit is
//! driven by abstract oracles (a VM-status closure, simulated claim
//! schedules) so the property suites can exercise adversarial inputs.
//!
//! C ground truth: REL_18_3 vacuumlazy.c `heap_vac_scan_next_block` /
//! `find_next_unskippable_block` (:1571/:1676) for the skip rules;
//! LVRelState counters (:313-357) for the fold classes (sums, XID mins,
//! block max, bool OR).
