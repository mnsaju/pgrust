//! `pgrust.parallel_engine` — the M5-3 planner-probe gate over the M5
//! product engine selector (design of record: docs/design/m5-planner.md
//! §2.2/§2.3, branch m5-design-v2).
//!
//! RECONCILED (m5-integration): the M5-3 lane bootstrapped this module with
//! a placeholder customized-option read of `pgrust.parallel_engine` (the
//! runtime_pool.rs pattern) because the product GUC was the router lane's
//! M5-0 deliverable. Both lanes are now merged: the REGISTERED enum GUC
//! (backing::pgrust_parallel_engine, consts::PARALLEL_ENGINE_*) is the one
//! source of truth and this module redirects to its M5-0 reader
//! (`runtime_pool::parallel_engine_is_runtime`) — the placeholder read is
//! deleted, exactly the redirect the bootstrap note promised.
//!
//! Contract (§2.2):
//!   * `pgrust.parallel_engine = legacy | runtime`, default **runtime**
//!     since the M5 boarding flip (§4.4 criteria met; boarded with
//!     coverage-keyed FloorGuards, min_dop=12). `legacy` restores the
//!     pre-M5 planning byte-for-byte.
//!   * `runtime` additionally requires the runtime pool to be LIVE
//!     (spawned; `runtime_pool::runtime_pool_live`, published by
//!     `launch_backend::rtpool::start` — the `pgrust.runtime` GUC is the one
//!     requested-state cell, seeded at boot by `PGRUST_RUNTIME`) and the
//!     lane master switch (`pgrust.lane_executor`). Absent either, the
//!     suppression stays inert with a loud-once log line (§2.2) — the
//!     plan-time twin of the router's executor-side degrade
//!     (execmain::lanev2::router checks `runtime::global()`; this probe
//!     checks the liveness flag the pool exports into guc_tables).
//!   * `PGRUST_M5_SUPPRESS=0|off` is the dedicated kill switch for the
//!     M5-3 coverage-keyed Gather suppression itself, independent of the
//!     engine selector (a runtime-mode server with suppression killed
//!     plans exactly like legacy; the executor router — M5-1 — is gated
//!     separately).

/// The M5-3 suppression kill switch: `PGRUST_M5_SUPPRESS=0|off` disables
/// the planner's coverage-keyed Gather suppression without touching the
/// engine selector (read once per process, like every arm kill).
