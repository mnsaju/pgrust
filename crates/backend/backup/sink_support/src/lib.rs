//! Port of `basebackup_progress.c` (PostgreSQL 18.3): the base-backup progress
//! sink plus the `basebackup_progress_*` entry points `basebackup.c` calls
//! directly. Besides reporting, it updates the [`BbsinkState`] fields other
//! sinks consult (bytes-done, tablespace index), forwarding everything else.
