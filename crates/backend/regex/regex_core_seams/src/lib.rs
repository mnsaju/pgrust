//! Seam declarations for the `backend-regex-core` unit (`backend/regex/*`:
//! `regcomp.c`, `regexec.c`, `regprefix.c`, `regfree.c`, `regerror.c`).
//!
//! The owning unit installs these from its `init_seams()` when it lands;
//! until then a call panics loudly.
//!
//! The compiled regex crosses this boundary as [`::regex::RegexCompiled`],
//! which carries the real engine-owned `regex_t` value type-erased as an
//! `Rc<dyn Any>`; the owning unit downcasts it back to its own `regex_t` (see
//! `types-regex` for why that real-value/downcast cycle-break introduces no
//! handle or opacity). One consequence: in C, `regexp.c` stores each compiled
//! regex in a dedicated per-regexp memory context and frees it with
//! `MemoryContextDelete`; here the free maps onto dropping the carrier (the
//! `pg_regfree` seam takes it by value).
//!
//! Failure surface: PostgreSQL 18's engine pallocs internally and runs
//! `CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS`, so every operation can `ereport(ERROR)` — hence
//! `PgResult`. The engine's *regex-level* failure codes (bad pattern, etc.)
//! are not `ereport`s: they come back as return codes that the caller turns
//! into its own error, so they are mirrored as the `Failed` /
//! non-`Compiled` arms of the result enums, carrying the
//! `pg_regerror`-formatted message (`regerror.c` owns the message table).
