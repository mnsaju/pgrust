//! BgBufferSync (bufmgr.c): the bgwriter's LRU-scan arm over the clock sweep.
//! The WritebackContext lives here (C: BgWriterMain's frame) so the bgwriter
//! crate needs no access to the private writeback plumbing.
//!
//! M4 bgjobs increment 3 (docs/design/m4-bgjobs.md §3.1): the control state
//! C kept in BgBufferSync statics — the clock-sweep tracking and EWMA
//! smoothing whose CONTINUITY the algorithm depends on — is an explicit
//! [`BgwSyncState`] owned by the caller, not thread-locals. The thread
//! daemon owns one on its main frame (identical behavior: the TLS was
//! per-daemon-thread state, the struct is per-daemon state); the job mode
//! (increment 4) owns one in the job envelope so cycles may execute on any
//! pool worker without resetting the control loop.
