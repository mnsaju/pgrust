//! Process-global relation-size cache: (RelFileLocator, fork) -> nblocks.
//!
//! C cannot have this: its smgr_cached_nblocks is per-backend and trusted
//! only during recovery, because cross-process coherence of size changes was
//! never solved (only the recovery-only cache landed upstream). One address
//! space changes the game: every in-process mutation of a relation file's
//! size flows through md (extend / zeroextend / truncate / create / unlink),
//! so updating the map at those points under the callers' existing locking
//! makes the cached value definitionally what lseek(SEEK_END) would report.
//! The one out-of-md size mutator (the columnar AM's direct-pwrite byte
//! stream) POISONS its key at writer open: poisoned keys always take the
//! real lseek walk, permanently, until the entry dies at unlink.
//!
//! Contract: `lookup` returns exactly what the mdnblocks segment walk would
//! return at every call site, or None (walk and `note_walked`). Temp
//! relations never enter the map (per-session files; the callers keep the
//! plain walk). Entries are removed at unlink/create (relfilenumber reuse
//! starts clean), purged by database at DROP/move DATABASE (file trees are
//! rm'd behind md's back there), and cleared wholesale around the unlogged-
//! relation reinit pass (init-fork copies rewrite main forks outside md).
//!
//! Concurrency: one read-mostly RwLock over a BTreeMap. Readers take the
//! shared lock for a point lookup; writers (rare: extension, truncate, DDL)
//! take it exclusively. Extension updates are monotonic max() so any
//! interleaving with a concurrent walk-populate converges on the true size;
//! truncation and other exact writes happen under the callers' exclusive
//! relation locking, exactly like the file operations they mirror.
