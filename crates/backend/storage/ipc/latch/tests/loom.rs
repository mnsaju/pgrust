//! DIRECT loom models of the latch lost-wakeup contract (LATCH-LOOM lane).
//!
//! Run: RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p latch --test loom --release
//!
//! These models drive the REAL production code — `latch::WaitLatch`,
//! `latch::SetLatch`, `latch::ResetLatch`, the real local-latch slab, and
//! the real waiter slot core underneath the park — not a mirror. They retire
//! the standing "latch is not loom-buildable → mirror models only"
//! disclosure (the latch-over-Waiter mirror in waiter/tests/loom.rs is now
//! superseded-but-kept; see notes/dst-latch-loom.md).
//!
//! What "lost wakeup" means: the waiter checks its flag (is_set), finds it
//! clear, and goes to sleep; the setter sets the flag and looks for a
//! sleeper to wake. If the two interleave so that the setter misses the
//! sleeper AND the sleeper misses the flag, the waiter sleeps forever with
//! its flag set — the lost wakeup. C latch.c prevents it with a Dekker
//! store->load discipline (pg_memory_barrier() pairs); the port renders
//! those barriers as fence(SeqCst) + the Latch protocol-edge methods.
//!
//! Model dialect (disclosed): loom 0.7 does not model the single total
//! order of SeqCst operations/fences (waiter/tests/loom_litmus.rs proves it
//! admits the SC store-buffer weak outcome; loom rt/thread.rs has SC-op
//! ordering literally disabled), so the fence-disciplined plain flag
//! accesses compile, UNDER LOOM ONLY, to the RMW dialect inside the Latch
//! methods, and the pg_memory_barrier() calls compile out (their strength
//! rides the RMW edges) — types_storage latch.rs, "THE DIALECT LAW" block,
//! including why write edges are Release swaps and why a live loom fence
//! would poison the model. The control flow, protocol structure, waker-word
//! publication, park/unpark composition, and the waiter slot state machine
//! are the production code verbatim — loom explores and verifies all of
//! THAT for real; each dialect edge stands in for exactly one C barrier at
//! equal-or-stronger ordering.
//!
//! Red battery (transient source weakenings, run + reverted; verdicts +
//! the R2 investigation in notes/dst-latch-loom.md):
//!   R1 strip the wake: delete set_latch's `waiter::unpark_word` call
//!      → CAUGHT, 3 models deadlock in 0.00s. The naked-wake control red.
//!   R2 wake-route order: publish the waker AFTER arming maybe_sleeping in
//!      wait_latch_on_waiter (the Dekker order the source comment pins)
//!      → CAUGHT, 3 models deadlock (the setter reads a stale waker word
//!      and skips the unpark). This red drove the dialect refinement: it
//!      passed silently under both the all-SeqCst-RMW translation and live
//!      loom fences — see the dialect-fidelity guards at the bottom.
//!   R3 omit SetLatch's FIRST pg_memory_barrier(): demote
//!      set_path_probe_is_set's loom arm to the native Relaxed load
//!      → CAUGHT: reset_rewait_cycle deadlocks (stale is_set=1 read after
//!      a concurrent ResetLatch skips the wake — the exact race C's
//!      ResetLatch comment names).
//!   R4 omit SetLatch's SECOND pg_memory_barrier(): demote
//!      set_path_sleeping_armed's loom arm to the native Acquire load
//!      → CAUGHT, 3 models deadlock in 0.26s (armed sleeper missed).
//!
//! Seam story (mission 3): the three wait-path seam registries
//! (waiteventset_seams, procsignal_seams, timeout_seams — plus
//! waitevent_seams' pgstat pair) compile under loom as-is and stay EMPTY in
//! models: their `is_installed()` guards read never-written statics, so the
//! drain hooks are inert, and nothing may install a seam inside
//! `loom::model` (seam slots are process-global — cross-iteration state, and
//! `set()` panics on the second iteration by design). "A signal fired" IS
//! `SetLatch` from another thread: the procsignal sender pends a signo and
//! calls SetLatch, the timeout timer thread posts and calls SetLatch — the
//! [`signal_world`] driver below is that exact call, which is why the models
//! need no installed seams to exercise the wake path.
