//! SimVfs — deterministic in-memory filesystem for DST (P1 skeleton + P4
//! fault model, increment 1).
//!
//! Owner: WS-C (contract §4, §5.1); P4 disk-fault model per
//! docs/design/dst-and-wasm.md §4.1. Compiled only under `--cfg pgrust_sim`
//! (the sim harness selector); never present in product builds. Run the sim
//! battery with `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg pgrust_sim' cargo test -p vfs sim::`.
//!
//! Shape (frozen surface, lib.rs): SimVfs is a ZST with `pub const fn new()`
//! — `ACTIVE` is a const. State homing has two modes (provider seam,
//! dst-p3-scheduler §9): the DEFAULT keeps ALL state in a thread-local (a
//! thread is a universe — every harness battery relies on that isolation);
//! a whole-server sim boot re-homes to ONE process-shared universe via the
//! boot installer [`SimVfs::install_process_universe`], because the server's
//! real OS threads must all see the same simulated disk. [`SimVfs::reset`]
//! tears the (thread-local) universe down (fresh disk, fd counter back to
//! base, NoFaults plan) for back-to-back runs on one thread.
//!
//! DETERMINISM RULES (binding, contract §4.1):
//! - BTree ordering ONLY — no HashMap/HashSet anywhere in this module.
//! - No wall clock: `FileInfo::mtime_*` is always 0 (a logical clock, if
//!   ever needed, comes from the harness).
//! - Monotonic fd assignment from a high base ([`SIM_FD_BASE`]) — small-int
//!   posix fds mixed into sim traffic fault loudly as EBADF, catching raw-fd
//!   domain mixups (the FileGetRawDesc carve-out).
//! - All randomness comes from explicit seeds (splitmix64 streams — the
//!   SimEntropy generator family); SimVfs itself contains ZERO ambient
//!   entropy sources. Same seed + same plan spec ⇒ same failure at the same
//!   op, and every injected fault is logged with an op-sequence number
//!   ([`SimVfs::fault_log`]) so a failure replays from the log line + the
//!   plan spec alone.
//!
//! THE P4 DISK-FAULT MODEL (scoping doc §4.1 — an adversarial SUPERSET of
//! what posix filesystems do, with three binding constraints):
//!
//! 1. **512 B atomicity floor** ([`SECTOR_SIZE`]): a write in flight at a
//!    crash survives as a prefix ending on an ABSOLUTE sector boundary (or
//!    the whole write) — never a partial sector, never atomic multi-sector.
//!    The floor is a documented model parameter; the test-only
//!    [`SimVfs::set_atomic_write_mode`] weakening exists ONLY so the red
//!    battery can prove the floor has teeth.
//! 2. **fsync-failure state machine** (the fsyncgate semantics): writes
//!    since the last SUCCESSFUL fsync form the unsynced journal. A FAILED
//!    fsync moves that journal to may-be-lost **permanently** — and (inc-2,
//!    review N2) "may be lost" is literal: the installed [`CrashImage`]
//!    policy decides which SUBSET of the doomed epoch already reached the
//!    platter before the error (kept ops fold into the durable image right
//!    then, possibly sector-torn; dropped ops are gone for good). A later
//!    successful fsync promotes only writes issued after the failure; the
//!    dropped part never resurrects, and never survives a crash. This is
//!    what distinguishes "we PANIC'd and recovered from WAL" (correct) from
//!    "we retried fsync, it said OK, and we believed it" (the fsyncgate
//!    bug) — and also catches protocols that assume "failed fsync ⇒ old
//!    bytes intact" (in-place multi-sector overwrite shapes). Inc-3 HARD
//!    MODE: the same state machine now covers DIRECTORIES — every namespace
//!    op is journaled as an unsynced dirent op on its parent, and a FAILED
//!    parent-dir fsync dooms that dirent epoch through the [`CrashImage`]
//!    policy (kept dirents fold into the durable entry image right then;
//!    dropped ones — a rename, say — are durably lost and no later
//!    successful fsync resurrects them).
//! 3. **Dirent durability requires the parent-dir fsync**: namespace ops
//!    (create/rename/unlink/mkdir/rmdir) are volatile until the PARENT
//!    directory is fsync'd. At a crash each directory's unsynced dirent
//!    journal routes through the SAME [`CrashImage`] policy as file
//!    journals (fsync is the only BARRIER on the namespace plane too — a
//!    kind disk may persist an un-fsync'd rename; the [`CrashImage::DropAll`]
//!    floor reverts every directory to its last fsync'd entry image), and
//!    the namespace is rebuilt from the root. The classic
//!    lost-dirent-after-rename bug class (missing fsync_parent_path in a
//!    durable_rename shape) is therefore testable — and caught.
//!
//! **Crash ("cut") primitive** ([`SimVfs::cut`]): discard everything not
//! durable per rules 1–3, deterministically. The surviving subset of each
//! file's unsynced journal is chosen by the installed [`CrashImage`] policy
//! (default [`CrashImage::DropAll`], the adversarial floor; seeded arbitrary
//! subsets via [`CrashImage::SeededSubset`] — fsync is the only barrier, so
//! unsynced writes may survive in any combination, sector-torn).
//!
//! **Whole-node kill** (inc-3, [`SimVfs::set_kill_on_cut`]): when armed, a
//! cut also FREEZES the node — every later vfs op is refused (EIO) without
//! consulting the plan and without mutating ANY state, until
//! [`SimVfs::revive`]. This closes the inc-2 review exposure: a writer
//! process that keeps executing past its crash point (error/unwind paths
//! issuing VFD reopens, repair flushes) could otherwise mutate the
//! post-crash image before the harness packs it. Default off: the
//! model-level batteries deliberately recover in the same universe.
//!
//! Namespace model: rooted at "/". Relative paths resolve against the boot
//! cwd, which defaults to the root (harness batteries address data dirs
//! absolutely or mint them at "/"; a whole-server boot sets it to the
//! datadir via [`SimVfs::set_boot_cwd`]). Entry
//! names must be UTF-8 (EINVAL otherwise). No symlinks: `lstat` ≡ `stat`,
//! `read_link` fails EINVAL like readlink(2) on a non-symlink. Where
//! platforms disagree on an errno, SimVfs speaks the Linux dialect (e.g.
//! EISDIR for unlink-of-directory).

// Shared universes (s2 §6 item 1) — one filesystem per SIMULATED PROCESS.
//
// C processes share one fd table across all their threads; pgrust's product
// backends are threads of one server process, so C-parity for the sim is:
// every thread of one simulated process sees ONE universe (namespace + fd
// table + fault engine). The universe lives in a process-global registry
// keyed by a caller-chosen u64 (the simulated-process id, minted by the
// harness — today exactly one sim server per harness, id 1); the id reaches
// children by parent-side capture at the spawn doors (`current_universe_id`
// next to `register_child`, `adopt_universe` right after `enter_child`) —
// process identity flows down the spawn tree the way fork inherits the fd
// table.
//
// CONCURRENCY: no locks. Soundness rests on the permit scheduler's
// one-runner-at-a-time invariant (exactly one registered thread executes at
// any moment), ASSERTED on every shared access through the injected probe
// below (vfs is a frozen leaf crate — libc + plain types, Cargo.toml §1.1 —
// so it cannot ask pgsync itself; the enabler injects a plain fn pointer).
// The probe is strict: true only when the global permit scheduler exists AND
// the calling thread currently holds the permit — sharing is only legal
// under the scheduler, and an unregistered thread touching a shared
// universe dies loudly at the access (the F6 loud-assert precedent).
// The RefCell stays: within a quantum it catches reentrancy exactly as the
// thread-local always did.
