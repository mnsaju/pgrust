//! Lane-v2 hash-grouped exact-DISTINCT aggregation — the uniqexact2 grouped
//! narrow-sort arm's named follow-up (lane-v2-distincthash). For the
//! sorted grouped exact-DISTINCT plan shape — `Sort(group cols, distinct arg) →
//! GroupAggregate(aggpresorted DISTINCT)` — the narrow-sort arm already
//! deletes the distinct-arg SUFFIX compares, but the group-prefix sort over
//! ALL input rows remains the dominant cost. This arm deletes that sort too:
//! rows group through a hash table whose every entry owns the group's
//! order-insensitive transition state plus one exact-DISTINCT set per
//! internal-sort entry (`distinctset::DistinctSet`, reused wholesale), and
//! the finalize orders the GROUPS (not the rows) by the plan Sort's prefix
//! before emitting through the unchanged finalize/HAVING/project tail.
//!
//! Byte identity vs the C path (and vs the narrow-sort arm, which is itself
//! byte-identical to C):
//!   * same groups: the group hash key is the representational image of the
//!     grouping columns (admission requires `group_eq_representational` AND
//!     integer-or-text group columns). Integer keys: word equality == the
//!     grouping equality operator's verdict. TEXT/VARCHAR keys: the stored
//!     image is the detoasted content bytes, and the grouping equality is
//!     `texteq` under a DETERMINISTIC collation (the representational
//!     admission's texteq arm), which IS length+memcmp of those bytes — so
//!     byte equality == the operator's verdict. NULL keys collapse to
//!     same-group exactly as C's grouping equality does;
//!   * same group ORDER: groups emit sorted by the plan Sort's key prefix —
//!     integer keys under the exact btree integer order (signed word
//!     compare), text keys under `varstr_cmp` with the plan Sort's
//!     collation (C's bttextcmp/ssup authority; the ported comparator
//!     carries C's deterministic memcmp tie-break, so byte-distinct keys
//!     never compare equal) — with the plan's ASC/DESC + NULLS FIRST/LAST
//!     flags. The prefix covers every grouping column (the narrow arm's
//!     multiset check), and two DISTINCT groups cannot compare equal on all
//!     of them, so the order is total and equals the order C's row sort
//!     induces on group boundaries;
//!   * same values: every transition is order-insensitive-EXACT
//!     (`trans_order_insensitive` — counting / exact integer / Int128
//!     accumulation) and runs through the SAME compiled transition program /
//!     set-replay machinery; the sets dedup exactly;
//!   * same representative: the projected group representative is the
//!     group's FIRST ROW IN SCAN ORDER rather than C's first-in-sorted-order
//!     row, but the only columns an Agg output can reference are grouping
//!     columns (byte-equal across the group's rows — representational
//!     equality) and aggregates, so no projected byte can differ.
//!
//! Memory / spill (work_mem safety): the arm meters everything it holds —
//! group key words, representative tuples, per-group transition state, and
//! (capacity-based, like the set's own accounting) every per-group set —
//! against HALF the displaced tuplesort's budget. Crossing it DEGRADES the
//! whole node to the narrow-sort arm mid-build, exactly once: the narrowed
//! tuplesort is begun (the sort the plan wanted, comparator narrowed to the
//! group prefix — spill-safe on its own), every group's DEFERRED
//! representative row is fed to it, remaining input rows stream to it
//! directly, and the emit chain is the narrow-sort arm's, with one addition:
//! `initialize_aggregates` PRELOADS a beginning group's saved partial state
//! (pergroup + sets) from the residual table, so pre-degrade rows are never
//! lost or double-counted. Representative rows are deferred (stored, not
//! transitioned) precisely so the degrade can hand each resident group's
//! sort representative to the tuplesort without double-counting: a group's
//! saved state holds every row EXCEPT its representative, and the
//! representative rides the sort like any other row. The other half of the
//! budget stays free for the emit phase's per-set replay/spill machinery
//! (a preloaded set that keeps growing crosses the FULL per-set budget and
//! spills/degrades through the existing per-set levers, one group live at a
//! time).
//!
//! Aggcontext discipline: many groups' by-ref transvalues live in the
//! node's aggcontext SIMULTANEOUSLY here, so the per-group-boundary
//! aggcontext reset is SKIPPED while hash-arm state exists (the reset would
//! free other groups' live transvalues); it resumes once the residual table
//! drains. The no-degrade emit path never resets aggcontext either (same
//! reason); per-output allocations still reset per group via ps_ExprContext.
