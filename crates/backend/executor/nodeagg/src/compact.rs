//! Lane-v2 compact-row aggregation table hosting (pgrcolumnar-v2 plan Stage 2.2).
//!
//! The `lanetable::LaneAggTable` replaces the C-ported tuplehash as the
//! GROUP BY table for a narrow, explicitly-admitted shape; everything else
//! keeps the C table exactly as today (refuse/fallback discipline). The
//! table owns LAYOUT AND PROBE ONLY — transition and finalize still run the
//! real C-ported aggregate code over `AggPerGroup` states stored in the
//! compact payload rows (zero-initialized at group birth, seeded by the same
//! `trans_init` datumCopy loop as `initialize_hash_entry`), so transvalues
//! are byte-identical to the C path's. Group OUTPUT ORDER diverges (row /
//! insertion order vs simplehash bucket order) — legal under the 2026-07-13
//! order-relaxation policy; ORDER BY-wrapped outputs are unaffected.
//!
//! Admission (v1, decided per build by the lane's scan-K2 feed — see
//! `execmain::lanev2`):
//!   * the scan-K2 shape already holds (AGG_HASHED, single grouping key with
//!     a kernel probe, fully lanefold-admitted transitions, no residuals,
//!     unguarded plan, key + needed columns staged in SoA lanes);
//!   * the key kernel is an INTEGER width (int2/int4/int8 — text keys keep
//!     the C table until the str8/arena hosting lands; the lanetable crate
//!     already implements it, microbench-proven);
//!   * `aggsplit == AGGSPLIT_SIMPLE`, or `AGGSPLIT_INITIAL_SERIAL` under an
//!     ARMED lane parallel pool (Stage 2.2 × Stage 4: worker partial builds
//!     use the compact table and export it into the merge handoff —
//!     `merge::maybe_install_handoff`'s compact arm; group estimates divide
//!     by the pool DOP, see `compact_split_divisor`);
//!   * NOT spill-eligible by estimate: planner `numGroups` must fit within
//!     HALF the hash-mem/ngroups limits (v1 policy: the compact table
//!     REFUSES spill-eligible plans; distinct-spill is v2, like the
//!     uniqExact lane). A RUNTIME BACKSTOP re-checks actual memory before
//!     every batch and MIGRATES to the C table when the half-limit is
//!     crossed (planner estimates lie — the rows=1 defect), after which the
//!     build continues on the C path, spill machinery intact. Peak memory
//!     during a migration is bounded by ~2× the half-limit = the limit.
//!
//! Memory accounting: `LaneAggTable::mem_used()` (entry arrays + row chunks
//! + arena, capacities not lengths) + the aggcontext's `subtree_used` stand
//! in for the C path's meta/entry/transvalue triple, compared against the
//! SAME `hash_mem_limit` at half margin — conservative by construction.

// `GROUP BY … ORDER BY <int8 finalfn-none agg> LIMIT k` shape (the exact
// topnemit spec — count(*)/count(x)/sum-int leading key) the downstream
// bounded tuplesort keeps only k of the ~ngroups finalized rows; the
// streaming topnemit boundary cut only elides groups STRICTLY worse than the
// live k-th boundary, which on flat count distributions (~10M-group class: the 10th
// boundary count is ~1) cuts nothing. This pass instead selects the k
// surviving groups FIRST — a bounded (badness, row) heap over the raw int8
// transvalues, one sequential read per group — so finalize (numeric avg
// division), key reconstruction, tuple forming and sort puts run for k
// groups instead of all of them.
//
// Tie semantics (docs/conformance/tie-ordering.md, rule 2 applied to agg
// groups): the heap's total order is (key, insertion row ascending) — the
// strict-better replacement (`badness < worst.badness` only; arriving rows
// have monotonically increasing row index, so an equal key can never evict a
// kept one) keeps the FIRST-ARRIVED members of the k-th key's tie group, a
// deterministic function of group birth order. C's bounded heap keeps a
// heap-shape-arbitrary subset of the same tie group, so the selected set is
// C-LEGAL but not byte-equal to a given lane-off run at a boundary tie —
// exactly rule 2's ratified surface (gates count-gate the boundary tie
// group). The lane arms this only in relaxed adaptive-topk mode; `tracked`
// / `0` remain byte-exact channels, and PGRUST_LANE_V2_TOPKFIN=0 kills the
// pass on its own.
//
// Fail-closed: any group whose leading-key transvalue is NULL or pending
// bails the WHOLE pass (a NULL's rank depends on NULLS placement — the
// tuplesort comparator stays the authority), before any side effect: the
// selection scan is read-only and the caller falls through to the exact
// pre-existing feed. Multi-column ORDER BY never admits (the k-th boundary's
// tie-break needs the secondary keys; the lane checks numCols == 1).
