//! Lane-v2 parallel exact-DISTINCT partials (lane-v2-pardistinct).
//!
//! The planner can never emit a Partial Agg for a DISTINCT aggregate
//! (prepagg hasNonPartialAggs), so the parallel plan for the plain and
//! grouped count(DISTINCT) shapes is always `Agg ← GatherMerge ← Sort ←
//! ParallelSeqScan`: workers sort ALL rows (group prefix + distinct-arg
//! suffix) and the leader deduplicates serially. This module supplies the
//! winning algorithm instead: the LEADER (which owns the Agg node and its
//! admission proofs) registers a build spec keyed by the Sort plan node's
//! address; each WORKER whose fragment top is that Sort skips the sort
//! entirely and drains its share of the shared claim cursor into a compact
//! group table — integer group-key words, a fixed per-transition vocabulary
//! of exact-integer partial states, and one exact-DISTINCT set
//! (`distinctset::DistinctSet`, reused wholesale) per distinct transition —
//! then installs the frozen table through a merge.rs-style handoff and
//! emits ZERO rows. The leader builds its own partial over the local
//! fragment (leader participation), folds any stray rows arriving through
//! the tuple queues (degraded/refused workers), merges the tables
//! (per-partition set union — partitions are disjoint by construction, so
//! the union has no cross-partition work), and emits through the serial
//! arms' unchanged finalize tails.
//!
//! Byte identity: the arm changes (a) which thread deduplicates — sets are
//! exact and their equality is representational (`distinct_set_kind`), (b)
//! the transfn REPLAY ORDER over the identical distinct-value multiset —
//! the admitted transitions are order-insensitive-exact, and (c) the
//! association order of the non-distinct vocabulary states — pure counting
//! and exact integer accumulation, reassociation unobservable. Groups,
//! group order (the plan Sort's prefix), and every projected byte match the
//! serial hashgrouped arm's identity argument.
//!
//! Memory: each worker meters its table (like the hashgrouped arm) and on
//! crossing FREEZES it (within budget), installs it, and degrades the
//! REMAINDER of its share to the classic path — the plan's real Sort is fed
//! the remaining rows and the worker emits them as ordinary sorted rows
//! (pre-freeze rows ride the frozen table, post-freeze rows ride the queue;
//! disjoint, exact). The leader's builder is mcx-backed: crossing evicts
//! the largest sets to the DistinctSet hash-partitioned spill tapes, so
//! leader memory stays budget-bounded and spilled sets replay through the
//! existing spilled-set machinery at finalize.

// Bounded selection inside the distinct sink (named-kernels-distinct kernel
// 2 — winners-phase2's flagged follow-up): on the paremit `GROUP BY k ORDER
// BY <int8 agg> LIMIT n` consumer shape, each combine claim selects its
// partition's top-`bound` groups ON THE RAW MERGED STATE (the distinct
// count IS the set's value count; vocab counts are the sidecar words —
// both state-comparable and never NULL, so there is no mid-combine decline
// face at all) and materializes ONLY those through the ordered emit bucket;
// the leader truncate-merges the per-partition candidate lists to the
// global winner set and the paremit merge emits winners alone, in the same
// group order as the full drain.
//
// Correctness is the winners-only superset lemma verbatim: partitions hold
// DISJOINT groups (value-hash routing), so a group in the global top-
// `bound` is beaten by fewer than `bound` groups anywhere — in particular
// inside its own partition — and survives its partition's list; the union
// of lists is a superset of the global top-`bound` and the truncate-merge
// recovers exactly it.
//
// Selection total order = (badness, GROUP ORDER): badness first (the
// monotone-worse image of the order value under the direction), ties by
// the plan Sort's prefix order over the group keys — the EXACT arrival
// order the full drain feeds the downstream bounded sort, whose C
// tuplesort keeps the first-arriving tuple among equals (a new tuple
// replaces the heap root only when strictly better). The winner set is
// therefore a pure function of the data AND identical to the set the full
// drain's bounded sort retains — the W≡F byte-identity argument. Within
// one partition the tie rank is the bucket row index (bucket rows are in
// group order); across partitions the leader compares tie candidates with
// `cmp_group_rows` on the bucket key sidecars (the ONE ordering
// authority).

// / distinctset `SpillState`) is untouched — the sink Locals still carry
// `mcx: None` and freeze()'s `!ever_spilled` invariant keeps holding. What
// spills here are the DistinctSet VALUES alone, through an operator-owned
// byte contract the caller writes to a spillset file: group keys, vocab
// words, and `seen_null` stay in memory and ride the Local through SEAL.
//
// Record contract, INT mode (fixed width per spec, native-endian — the
// DistinctSet int law, raw i64 words): one record per (group, set, value) =
//   [keynulls u64][key word i64 × nkeys][set index u64][value i64]
// NULLs NEVER touch the file: group-key null bits ride the keynulls word
// (part of the group identity, not a value), and set NULL presence rides
// the in-memory `seen_null` (the distinctset frozen rule).
//
// Record contract, BYTES mode (distinct-bytes car — engaged iff
// `spec.has_bytes_keys()`; variable width, self-describing, 8-aligned):
//   [rec_len u64][keynulls u64][set index u64][value i64]
//   [key word i64 × nkeys (bytes components ZEROED — the c3 canonical-image
//    discipline: content identifies, table-relative spans never spill)]
//   [per bytes component, ascending, non-NULL only: len u64 + content,
//    zero-padded to 8]
// `rec_len` is the whole record (multiple of 8), so files stay 8-aligned
// and a record-aligned streamer can carry partial tails. The VALUE sits at
// the fixed offset 24 in both the parse and the value-hash router. The
// canonical key image (zeroed words + length-prefixed tails in component
// order) is injective: fixed-width prefix + length-prefixed tails.
//
// Partition law (both modes): top-8 bits of the group-key hash
// (`hash >> 56`, canonical `row_hash` — content-derived for bytes keys) —
// EXACTLY the counting-sort partition freeze() builds and the bucket merge
// reads, so a spilled record replays into the same combine partition that
// claims its group. Spill/replay AUTHORITY is insertion order per the m3.5
