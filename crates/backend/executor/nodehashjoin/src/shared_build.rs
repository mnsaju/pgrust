//! M3 shared-build hash join — the two-phase (Leis-style) build core.
//!
//! Design authority: docs/design/m3-joins.md §3 (JoinBuildLocal:
//! materialize + count, thread-local), §4 (partitioned single-writer
//! combine, run-ordered deterministic chains, 16-bit tag words), §5
//! (match flags for the right-fill family). This module is PURE data
//! structure + algorithm: no executor, no runtime-crate dependency —
//! the ParallelSink impl and engagement wiring arrive in inc-2
//! (execmain/lanev2/runtime_hashjoin.rs), mirroring the m2-agg-sink
//! split (nodeagg/src/sink.rs core vs execmain wiring).
//!
//! # Chain order: reproducible, NOT a correctness contract
//!
//! AMENDED per Michael's 2026-07-13 directive ("we shouldn't have to
//! guarantee the same order", m3-joins.md §4): order-insensitive
//! emission is the baseline join semantics and the gate oracle is
//! tie-normalized comparison. The run-ordered walk below is retained
//! only because it is free and makes failures reproducible; any future
//! increment may replace it with naive per-Local insertion order, and
//! no design (spill, skew, right-fill, probe) may depend on chain
//! order. Mechanically:
//!
//! The serial build inserts inner rows in scan order, each at its
//! bucket's CHAIN HEAD. Here every accepted morsel is recorded as a RUN
//! (`begin_run(range_start)` … `end_run()`); morsel ranges are disjoint,
//! so `range_start` totally orders the runs regardless of which worker
//! claimed what, in what order, at what adaptive sizing. Combine walks
//! runs ascending by `range_start`, within a run in materialization
//! (= scan) order, head-inserting — reproducing the serial chain
//! byte-for-byte for every bucket. The property tests below drive
//! adversarial claim schedules (single-worker-takes-all, maximal
//! interleave, ramp/photo-finish sizing, non-ascending per-worker claim
//! order) against a serial reference build.
//!
//! # Concurrency contract (enforced by the caller, asserted here)
//!
//! - A `JoinBuildLocal` is single-threaded (one worker's sink Local).
//! - `CombinePlan::combine_partition(part, locals)` is called EXACTLY ONCE per
//!   partition (the ParallelSink combine contract); a partition's bucket
//!   range and its tuples' `next` words have a single writer. Stores are
//!   relaxed atomics; cross-task visibility is the runtime's task-set
//!   completion barrier (deps DAG + last-worker-out, Loom-verified in
//!   the runtime crate).
//! - After `finish()`, the table is frozen: probe reads everything;
//!   the ONLY writes are the right-fill match flags (idempotent
//!   monotonic atomic, §5), read by the FILL phase after the probe
//!   set's completion barrier.
