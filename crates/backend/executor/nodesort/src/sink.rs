// M3 sort — top-N sink kernels (docs/design/m3-sort.md §3, inc-1).
//
// The POD bounded (key, rowref) heap on the tie-ordering rule-2 total order
// (docs/conformance/tie-ordering.md): an entry is ONE u128 word packing
// (null tier, direction-folded key word, 48-bit physical rowref), compared
// as a plain integer. Rowrefs are unique across a scan (disjoint granule
// claims — the caller's invariant), so two entries can never compare equal
// and the `bound` smallest elements of any union are a PURE FUNCTION of the
// table contents — independent of morsel claim order, worker count, and
// arrival interleaving. That is the whole determinism argument of the
// parallel top-N sink: no tie tracking, no demote ladder, nothing to
// ratify (the property rule 2 bought the serial adaptive feed, inherited).
//
// Deliberately NOT a Tuplesort: the tuplesort is Mcx-bound (a Send story
// would need lifetime erasure, the m2-distinct lane's unsafe argument) and
// its C-parity machinery buys nothing for a ≤ 65536-entry POD heap whose
// selection semantics are defined by ratified rule 2, not by C's
// heap-shape accidents. The serial sort arms remain the parity oracle.
//
// Phase-1 vocabulary: single int-family sort key widened to i64 at the
// read leg (the refsort/zone-entry mapping); DESC and NULLS FIRST/LAST
// fold into the encoding (§ TopnEntry::encode). The SealedParallelSink
// impl over these kernels lands with the engagement arm (execmain
// lanev2/runtime_sort.rs, inc-2) — the m2 house pattern: pure kernels in
// the operator crate, the contract impl at the engagement seam. Kernel
// worker roles: accept = TopnHeap::push (+ `admits` for the keep mask),
// seal = TopnHeap::into_sorted (parallel per Local), combine =
// topn_merge (partitions() = 1), leader gather decodes TopnEntry::rowref.
