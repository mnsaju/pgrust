//! SERIAL LEASE v2 — floor-gated, donation-aware CPU-seat accounting for
//! session threads (GL-SLEASE-2; Michael's rebuild charter).
//!
//! WHAT IT IS FOR (unchanged since GL-SLEASE-1): one permit ledger for the
//! whole machine — the runtime's execution-permit semaphore accounts pool
//! workers; the lease accounts session threads into the SAME ledger, so
//! sustained serial CPU and pool parallelism cannot oversubscribe cores.
//!
//! WHY v1 DIED (GL-RO-BISECT-2): v1 acquired a permit on EVERY top-level
//! ExecutorRun and HELD IT ACROSS BLOCKING I/O. With permits =
//! available_parallelism, an OLTP posture with backends >> cores convoyed
//! 32-64 I/O-bound backends over ~4 permits (witnessed ~20pp read-only
//! C-ratio collapse; scratchpad/night/GL-RO-BISECT-2-letter.md).
//!
//! THE v2 MECHANISM — two composed rules, both at session altitude:
//!
//! 1. LAZY FLOOR ADMISSION: entering a top-level run publishes a per-thread
//!    slot (a handful of relaxed stores — no lock, no semaphore traffic)
//!    and nothing else. A background sweeper (spawned on first armed enter)
//!    scans slots at a fixed cadence; a run whose ACTIVE age — wall age
//!    minus its reported-wait time (GL-SLEASE-3: the wait-seam wrappers
//!    stamp every C-parity blocking span into the slot's blocked ledger, so
//!    an I/O-bound run is never counted "expensive" for its storage/client
//!    waits; `PGRUST_RUNTIME_SERIAL_LEASE_WALLAGE=1` restores the v2
//!    wall-age posture for A/B) — exceeds the floor
//!    (`PGRUST_RUNTIME_SERIAL_LEASE_FLOOR_MS`, default 250) gets its
//!    owner's InterruptPending raised (the timeout timer-thread pattern),
//!    and the owner acquires its permit at the next CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS —
//!    a canonical safe point (never inside a critical section; the
//!    ProcessInterrupts holdoff gates run first). Point/short interactive
//!    queries finish under the floor and NEVER touch the semaphore: the
//!    zero-OLTP-tax bar holds by construction, and the interactive class is
//!    deliberately ungoverned (the governed class is sustained serial CPU).
//!
//! 2. I/O DONATION: while the permit is held, every C-parity blocking wait
//!    donates it. The wait-report seam pair is the single choke point every
//!    ported blocking site already brackets its sleep with; when the lease
//!    is armed, seams_init installs wrappers that call the real reporters
//!    and then this module's hooks: wait-start with a held permit releases
//!    it (state Donated); wait-end reacquires by TRY — on failure the run
//!    continues permit-less in Deficit (never blocks while holding
//!    arbitrary locks mid-wait-path; the deadlock class v1's engagement
//!    yield dodged by construction) and the sweeper re-flags it so the next
//!    safe point re-admits with a bounded `acquire_timeout`. A permit is
//!    therefore held only while the query is actually ON CPU.
//!
//! Safe-point admission is BOUNDED (`ADMIT_TIMEOUT`): CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS
//! runs with heavyweight locks / buffer pins legally held, and a permit
//! holder that is not donation-registered (a pool worker outside its
//! declared spill sections) may block on exactly those — an unbounded
//! admission wait could deadlock against it. Timing out to Deficit keeps
//! the session live at a throttled duty cycle (sweeper re-flag -> bounded
//! wait -> slice of work), which is the admission semantics under
//! contention anyway.
//!
//! Umbra-model note (the architectural north star, coordinator steer): in
//! the end state serial queries run as dop-1 pool tasks, I/O suspends the
//! task rather than the thread, and this whole module is dead code. Every
//! hook here is therefore deliberately shallow: two wait-seam wrappers, one
//! ProcessInterrupts tap, one RAII pair in executor_run_seam — nothing
//! reaches deeper into the executor than the blocking points require, so
//! task-ified serial execution deletes this file and four call sites.
//!
//! DEFAULT OFF (the GL-RO-BISECT-2 re-flip posture): `armed()` keeps the
//! t35 spelling — `PGRUST_RUNTIME_SERIAL_LEASE=1` arms; anything else is
//! the unleased pre-flip posture, byte-exact (no sweeper thread, no seam
//! wrappers, no tap — seams_init installs the stock reporters).
//!
//! Structurally inert without a runtime (`runtime::global()` None — no
//! permit ledger exists to unify). Depth guard: nested executor runs (SPI,
//! triggers, RI checks) lease nothing, so re-entry never self-deadlocks on
//! the permit cap. Classic parallel-worker ExecutorRun instances are
//! top-level in their own threads and are governed like sessions (v1
//! parity): floor-gated, donation-registered, deficit-throttled — never
//! deadlocked (progress is guaranteed by the bounded admission wait).
//!
//! wasm32: no threads — the sweeper cannot exist, so an armed lease never
//! admits anyone (runs stay Pending, permit-less). Same known-limitation
//! class as the inert wasm timeout timer.
