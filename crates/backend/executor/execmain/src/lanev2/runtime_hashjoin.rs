//! M3 RUNTIME HASH JOIN — the shared-build hash join on the morsel runtime
//! (docs/design/m3-joins.md; parent plan parallelism-redesign-2026-07 §5-M3)
//! + the M3.5 SPILL inc-4/5 batch arm (docs/design/m3.5-spill.md §5: batch
//! files on the SpillSet substrate, PLAN-BATCHES with exact sizes, chained
//! per-leaf build/probe task sets, recursive splits with a depth cap).
//!
//! Shape (phase 1): a SERIAL-plan plain Agg over a HashJoin over two
//! lane-fusible pgrcolumnar SeqScans. UNBATCHED (budget fits — the dormant
//! default) it is THREE runtime task sets:
//!
//!   [0] BUILD-ACCEPT   inner-scan granules → filter/project → per-worker
//!                      JoinBuildLocal (materialize + count; sink accept)
//!   [1] BUILD-COMBINE  256 partitions, deps=[0] — partitioned single-writer
//!                      table construction; finalize publishes the frozen
//!                      table (the ParallelSink pair via sink_tasksets)
//!   [2] PROBE          outer-scan granules, deps=[1] — per row: hash → tag
//!                      → chain → recheck → joinqual/otherqual → null-fill
//!                      arms → the plain-agg partial absorb (M1's
//!                      runtime_partial tail)
//!
//! BATCHED (M3.5, admission estimates nbatch > 1 and the spill arm is on),
//! the same RG grows the batch axis — a STATIC ladder (the runtime's task
//! sets and deps are fixed at submit; sources whose sizes only PLAN-BATCHES
//! knows are DEFERRED — their granule totals are set before their set can
//! publish, sequenced by the deps DAG):
//!
//!   [0] BUILD-ACCEPT   rows route by batch: batch 0 → the Local (as above);
//!                      batch k>0 → the worker's inner batch file (M3.5
//!                      batch records on SpillSet). Batch-0 budget crossing
//!                      DEMOTES batch 0 to a file batch (§5.2) instead of
//!                      refusing.
//!   [1] BUILD-COMBINE  batch-0 table (skipped when demoted).
//!   [2] PLAN-BATCHES   single task: EXACT per-batch sizes from the spill
//!                      directories + router counters → leaf map; batches
//!                      over the envelope enqueue SPLIT rounds.
//!   [3..3+R)           SPLIT-ROUND r: repartition oversized batches by
//!                      deeper remix bits into child files; still-oversized
//!                      children go to the next round; depth cap → refusal.
//!   [P]  PROBE(0)      outer rows route by the FROZEN leaf map: in-memory
//!                      leaf probes inline; file leaves append (hash, tuple)
//!                      to the worker's outer file. The map never changes
//!                      after this point — outer files are never
//!                      repartitioned (§5.2/§5.3).
//!   [P+1] FILL(0)      right-fill family only.
//!   then per leaf slot i (chained, ONE LIVE TABLE at a time — C parity):
//!      ACCEPT(i)       inner leaf extents → per-worker Locals
//!      COMBINE(i)      leaf table build + publish
//!      PROBE(i)        outer leaf extents → probe + absorb
//!      FILL(i)         right-fill family only; drops the leaf table.
//!
//! Engagement layering (identical to M1/M2): PGRUST_RUNTIME=1 +
//! `SET pgrust.runtime_hashjoin_pool = <dop>` + lane master switch, with
//! `PGRUST_RUNTIME_HASHJOIN=0` as the dedicated arm kill and
//! `PGRUST_RUNTIME_HASHJOIN_SPILL=0` restoring the phase-1 nbatch>1 refusal
//! exactly. The plan surface stays the serial plan; every refusal falls
//! through to the serial arms byte-identically (nothing consumed).
//!
//! Ordering contract (Michael's 2026-07-13 directive): order-insensitive
//! emission is the baseline; the probe feeds an order-insensitive plain-agg
//! partial tail, and the gates use tie-normalized comparison. Batch
//! processing order is a scheduling choice, not a semantic one (§9).
//!
//! Memory (§6/§7): admission decides batching with the C combined rule
//! (`exec_choose_hash_table_size_full(try_combined_hash_mem=true)`); each
//! live table — batch 0 and every file leaf — gets the RAW combined
//! envelope `get_hash_memory_limit() × (dop+1)` (one gang-shared table at
//! a time; exec_choose's rebalance-reduced `space_allowed` sized C's
//! per-worker tables and over-fanned splits — the train-14 inc-4/5 ledger
//! item). PLAN-BATCHES checks EXACT file bytes + tuple counts against an
//! exact-arithmetic capacity model (never estimates — the agg/distinct
//! duplicate-inflation class does not exist here); router buffers are
//! bounded constants per worker. Every spill syscall brackets the SpillIo
//! blocking-section facade (inside spillset).

// m5p1 MULTIBUILD (band 88001) — the multi-pipeline QuerySpec plan-walk.
//
// The matrix row `hashjoin-multibuild-sql` named the gap: "NO arm admits 2+
// build sides in one engagement (DAG substrate runtime-ready; the
// multi-pipeline QuerySpec plan-walk is the missing piece)". This section is
// that walk: a SERIAL-plan plain Agg over a TREE of probe-local hash joins
// (INNER/LEFT/SEMI/ANTI — no fill task sets, no match-flag barriers) over
// lane-fusible SeqScans decomposes into PIPELINES (Hyper/Umbra decomposition
// at this altitude):
//
//   * one BUILD pipeline per join j: drive the scan at the bottom of j's
//     build subtree, probe every frozen table on the way up INSIDE the build
//     subtree, and accept the emitted rows into table j (ACCEPT/COMBINE task
//     set pair via `runtime::sink_tasksets`, dormant-default machinery);
//   * one PROBE pipeline (last): drive the root outer-descent scan, probe
//     the root-path tables bottom-up, absorb into the plain-agg partial tail
//     (M1's runtime_partial, verbatim).
//
// Pipelines are emitted build-subtrees-first, so every accept's deps (the
// COMBINEs of the tables it probes) precede it — a deps-DAG the DEFAULT
// sequential dispatch executes exactly like the M3.5 spill ladder does
// (PGRUST_RUNTIME_PIPELINE_DAG stays orthogonal: ON overlaps independent
// build subtrees, OFF runs them in emission order).
//
// UNBATCHED ONLY: every build side must fit nbatch==1 under the C combined
// rule — an estimate above it refuses to the serial arms (the spill ladder
// stays single-join; its row owns any future multibuild-spill flip). The
// single-join arm above is byte-untouched: trees divert at the shape gate
// behind `hj_multibuild_enabled` and everything below runs only for them.
