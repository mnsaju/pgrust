//! M2 RUNTIME AGGREGATION SINK — the parallel GROUP BY engagement
//! (docs/design/m2-sinks.md §2 donor A, notes/m2-agg-sink.md).
//!
//! Shape (phase 1): a SERIAL-plan hashed Agg (AGGSPLIT_SIMPLE) over an
//! unprojected pgrcolumnar SeqScan, K2 single-int-key compact class, byval
//! whitelist transitions with catalog combine functions, identity emit —
//! executed as one runtime ParallelSink (ACCEPT + COMBINE task sets) at
//! DOP N on the M1 pinned-RG machinery. The plan surface stays the serial
//! plan; engagement is FORCED/explicit:
//!
//!   PGRUST_RUNTIME=1  (pool spawned at postmaster start, M0 kill switch)
//!   SET pgrust.runtime_agg_pool = <dop>   (never consulted by the planner)
//!
//! Execution model:
//!  * LEADER: admission (fail-closed — every refusal is the serial arm,
//!    byte-identically) → parallel context + query-task binding policy →
//!    submit a PINNED RG with the sink's two task sets → launch N helpers →
//!    park (WaitForParallelWorkersToFinish-shaped loop). On completion it
//!    adopts the published per-bucket EmitBufs and becomes a pure emitter.
//!  * HELPERS (bound, at POST_TASK_PARK): build a thread-local executor
//!    over the worker PlannedStmt (root = the Agg subtree), arm the SINK
//!    build (staging + K2 + compact table under the sink cap), then drive
//!    the pinned RG: ACCEPT morsels run the narrow ranged drain below
//!    (survivor collect → compact batch probe → whole-batch fold — the
//!    serial lane's own kernels over the claimed granule range); COMBINE
//!    morsels merge one radix bucket across all sealed Locals and
//!    finalize+project it (paremit) into a self-contained EmitBuf.
//!  * Local discipline (R3/R5): the worker's compact table lives in its
//!    sink Local between morsels (lend/reclaim by move); at the sink cap it
//!    flushes into a radix-partitioned SinkRun; table + run bytes are
//!    budgeted against `work_mem × hash_mem_multiplier` per Local — a
//!    crossing records a BUDGET REFUSAL, aborts the RG, and the leader
//!    falls back to the serial arm (whole-attempt rerun; nothing consumed
//!    twice).
//!
//! WFIN markers (M0 acceptance instrument contract): emitted by the
//! runtime's generic sched.rs channel under `PGRUST_MORSEL_MARKERS=1` —
//! `MORSEL|WFIN|qid=..|pipe=..|worker=..|t_us=..|tasks=..|task_avg_us=..`
//! per (worker, task set); pipe = task-set index. Under the default 3-set
//! sealed plumbing (combine-parallel lane): 0 = ACCEPT, 1 = FREEZE (parallel
//! per-Local SEAL), 2 = COMBINE; under `PGRUST_RUNTIME_AGG_PARSEAL=0` the
//! 2-set layout is 0 = ACCEPT, 1 = COMBINE (and the single-threaded SEAL
//! emits its own `MORSEL|AGGSEAL|arm=2set|...|dur_us=..` line when markers
//! are armed). The arm's own duplicate WFIN emitter was removed at
//! m2-integration: with the sched channel armed, double emission (different
//! time bases) garbled the instrument parser's spread verdicts.

/// aggcontext of a pool thread's bound executor, whose lifetime is the
/// THREAD's binding, not the table's. That is what crashed the release
/// candidate, witnessed e2e (the crashing statement's own engagement prints
/// `drain=Mk … str_arena_armed=0`).
///
/// Note on the precise failure, because the lane's first reading of it was
/// wrong and the correction matters to anyone extending this: an in-pod census
/// of the aggcontext home per table found **zero** changes of home during the
/// build, i.e. a Local's table is served by ONE thread for the whole
/// engagement and its transvalues do NOT get scattered across several
/// contexts. The failure is therefore a LIFETIME failure, not a
/// multiple-allocator failure: one home, retired (thread unbound, aggcontext
/// released or rebound by the next statement) while the combine/emit phase
/// still reads through the pointers — which is why the observed errors are
/// `runtime agg sink combine panicked` and a shape violation "in a sink
/// combine/emit", both AFTER the build. A table-owned store fixes it under
/// either reading, since it both travels with the table and outlives any
/// thread's context; do not weaken it to a per-thread home on the argument
/// that tables turn out not to migrate mid-build.
///
/// So the arming lives HERE, at the single exit every drain passes through,

/// than on a drain identity. A drain added later inherits it; a drain arm that
/// forgets to opt in cannot exist. Shapes with no by-ref str transvalue arm
/// nothing and are allocation-identical to before.
///
/// This is one half of the fix. The other half is the fail-closed check in
/// `agg_fold_staged_mm`: reaching a str advance on a sink build with no store
/// armed is a shape error, not a silent fall-back to the aggcontext. Together

// α-gate controller (cachebudget lane — Müller et al., SIGMOD 2015 "Cache-
// Efficient Aggregation: Hashing Is Sorting", the ADAPTIVE controller,
// adapted to the sink's bounded-Local flush discipline).
//
// The DOP-aware budget (agg192-contention) sizes every worker's locality
// table as a share of the shared cache — but a share is only WORTH holding
// when the table actually collapses rows (repeat keys fold in place). When
// a worker's key stream is near-unique, the table is a WRITE BUFFER: every
// row inserts, nothing folds, and its cache residency buys nothing while
// still charging the aggregate SLC budget the other workers' tables need
// (the window-B root cause, at any width). Müller's runtime signal
// adjudicates this per worker with zero synchronization: at table FILL
// compute the collapse ratio α = rows-absorbed / distinct-entries-flushed.
// α below α₀ ⇒ demote that worker's flush threshold to the byte-denominated
// L2 floor (agg192's — the flush scatter shares the private cache, so the
// floor is bytes at the shape's entry estimate) and flush through; α at or
// above α₀ ⇒ keep the budget share. Re-probe after ~10× the full table's
// row volume (Müller's hysteresis: one full-cap fill window re-adjudicates
// a phase change; a wrong re-probe costs footprint only — the retained
// capacity means no realloc).
//
// Byte-identity law: the effective cap changes only WHEN flushes happen —
// flush cadence is semantics-free (the dopcap precedent: runs merge
// first-seen, W≡F≡D and selection totality are cadence-independent) — and
// the controller is per-Local thread-owned state with ZERO new shared
// writes (the condcache lesson). Demotion requires a first full-cap FILL,
// so engagements that never fill (low NDV, adopt/pass-through shapes) are
// byte-and-time identical by construction. Freeze-armed (LIMIT-k) shapes
// are structurally excluded at engagement (bounded output, nothing to buy).
// Kill switch: PGRUST_RUNTIME_AGG_ALPHAGATE=0.
