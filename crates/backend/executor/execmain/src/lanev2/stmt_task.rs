//! GL-STMTTASK-1 increment 1 — SERIAL STATEMENT AS A DOP-1 POOL TASK
//! (statement-as-task migration step 1; proposal
//! scratchpad/night/proposal-serial-as-task-migration.md).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! The narrowest honest slice of the structural fix for the admission-control
//! class: for an ADMITTED simple-protocol read-only statement, the session
//! thread stops executing the plan itself. It publishes the statement's
//! executor run as a dop-1 engagement on the runtime pool (the same
//! bound/standing engagement substrate every lane arm rides), parks, and
//! drains result rows from the row-emit funnel to the ordinary wire receiver.
//! The WAITING unit (this engagement) and the CPU unit (a pool worker) become
//! different objects; the session thread does protocol only.
//!
//! # Architecture (increment 1, as built)
//!
//! - IDENTITY: the worker wears the session's identity through the
//!   query-task binder (`parallel::with_query_task_binding`) exactly as pool
//!   engagements already do — leased bgworker-shaped PGPROC, lock-group
//!   membership under the session leader, the session's transaction +
//!   active-snapshot + GUC view bound for the drive span. Channel ladder:
//!   pool-db bound engagement (`PGRUST_RUNTIME_POOLDB=1`, per-RG board,
//!   concurrent) first, standing gang second (one board process-wide —
//!   correctness vehicle only), then FALL BACK TO THE INCUMBENT serial loop
//!   byte-identically. There is deliberately NO launched-bgworker fallback:
//!   a statement task that cannot ride a standing thread refuses.
//! - RESULT STREAMING: the worker never touches the client socket. It builds
//!   its own QueryDesc over the shared PlannedStmt and runs the ordinary
//!   per-tuple pull loop (`exec_proc_node`, junk filter included — the
//!   execute_plan plain-loop shape), materializing each result tuple into an
//!   owned MinimalTuple image pushed through the bounded row funnel
//!   ([`super::row_emit::RowEmitSink`]). The session thread drains the
//!   funnel and feeds the REAL DestReceiver (printtup → pqcomm): startup
//!   (RowDescription) already ran on the session thread in
//!   standard_executor_run, shutdown runs there after we return.
//! - PARK/WAKE: the session thread parks on the leader latch
//!   (`parallel::wait_parallel_finish_quantum`); funnel pushes/done set the
//!   latch through the funnel wake hook. The engagement enters the pool as
//!   a fresh (undecayed, p0) RG: under POOL-QOS the scheduler classifies it
//!   INTERACTIVE (sched.rs `qos_interactive_p`: priority >= p0 ⇔ < one
//!   decay quantum of consumed CPU) and its bound width feeds the
//!   interactive-demand ledger (`qos_demand_live`) that draws demoted
//!   serves' permit deferrals and serve-yields — the protection the needle
//!   latency measurement rides.
//! - ERROR IDENTITY: a worker-side ERROR is recorded first-wins in the
//!   payload as the ORIGINAL boxed PgError (message, sqlstate, hints,
//!   position travel by ownership) and re-raised on the session thread
//!   after the engagement joins — the client sees the same ErrorResponse
//!   bytes the incumbent path would have produced, including after rows
//!   were already streamed (mid-statement framing preserved: partial rows
//!   then the error, exactly the stock executor-error cadence). FATAL-class
//!   worker exits are NOT forwarded in inc-1: the exit-committed unwind
//!   kills the worker thread (its proc_exit drain owns cleanup), the
//!   Drop-guaranteed detach satisfies the join, and the leader raises the
//!   died-needle ERROR.
//! - INTERRUPTS: cancel / statement_timeout / client-loss land on the
//!   SESSION thread (its vpid owns the statement); the parked leader
//!   observes them at its CFI/quantum cadence and CHASES the task:
//!   close funnel demand (frees ring-parked producers, stops emit-side
//!   work), abort the RG, and deliver a thread cancel signal to the
//!   serving worker's leased identity (`procsignal::SendThreadSignal(pid,
//!   SIGINT)` — the pg_cancel_backend vector; the drive bracket registers
//!   the cancel disposition on the worker, mirroring the launched-bgworker
//!   signal set, so the worker's next CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS — the same
//!   per-page/per-row cadence C cancels at — raises, unwinds through the
//!   ordinary worker error path, and detaches). The leader then drains the
//!   RG bounded and joins the board; the statement's error is the LEADER's
//!   own cancel disposition, byte-identical to stock.
//!
//! # Envelope (everything else refuses BY NAME to the incumbent path)
//!
//! Simple protocol only (exec_simple_query arms exactly one statement's
//! top-level portal run — see `arm_statement`), single statement, CMD_SELECT
//! with a parallel-safe plan tree, no FOR UPDATE (rowMarks), no modifying
//! CTE, no result relations, complete-drain runs only (count = 0 — cursor
//! and extended-protocol row-limited cadences never arm), Remote dest, no
//! instrumentation, no EPQ, non-aborted non-subtransaction session state,
//! binder policy clean (no temp state, not serializable, no pending
//! invalidations, no bound params). The refusal taxonomy is
//! [`StmtTaskRefusal`]; every refusal of an ARMED statement ticks its named
//! counter and (traced builds) a `stmt-task: refused <reason>` line.
//!
//! # Knob
//!
//! `PGRUST_STMT_TASK` — DEFAULT OFF; arms on exactly `1`/`on` (t35
//! exact-spelling law, the pooldb posture parser precedent). OFF is
//! structurally inert: the only knob-OFF cost is the arm-site memoized
//! bool read in exec_simple_query; the executor hook short-circuits on the
//! thread-local armed flag, which OFF can never set.
//!
//! # Bounded resources (contention-evidence laws)
//!
//! This arm CREATES no new bounded resource. It rides three existing
//! bounds, cited per the proposal-contention-evidence-laws discipline:
//! pool execution permits (= cores; the worker's drive holds one under the
//! standard step rhythm, released around parks/blocking sections — the
//! donation facade), external pin-board lanes (MAX_EXTERNAL_LANES; the
//! serving worker's drive leases one; exhaustion = named refusal, never a
//! wait), and the per-worker funnel ring (DEFAULT_RING_CAP rows; the
//! producer parks under the K-standby blocking section, woken by drain or
//! demand-close — never while holding an execution obligation).

//! # Increment 2 (GL-STMTTASK-2) — kill the per-statement ceremony
//!
//! Four changes (scratchpad/night/wakeup-cost-survey.md "Convergent design
//! rules", cited by rule):
//!
//! 1. STANDING-ENGAGEMENT REUSE (`PGRUST_STMT_TASK_STANDING`, default ON
//!    under the master knob; `0`/`off` kills): the per-SESSION funnel is
//!    created once and reset per statement (`RowFunnel::reset_for_reuse`),
//!    and the WORKER side binds through the deferred binder with STICKY
//!    session retention — statement N+1 from the same session pays only
//!    the statement-half resume (`resume_statement`: transaction adopt,
//!    snapshots, invals drain), never the full session bind. Survey rule 6
//!    (ceremony is many slices): the funnel ring allocation and the
//!    session-half GUC/identity ceremony were two of them.
//! 2. POINTER-PASSING, NOT DSM RITUAL (`PGRUST_STMT_TASK_PTRPASS`, default
//!    ON under the master knob; `0`/`off` restores the inc-1 pcxt
//!    ceremony): the binder target is built by
//!    `parallel::statement_task_shared` — no parallel-context list entry,
//!    no error mailboxes, no registry key, no DestroyParallelContext walk;
//!    session-stable state travels by Arc (GUC pin, record registry,
//!    combocid), the plan by leader-arena pointer (inc-1's SendConst), the
//!    snapshot as the thread-native Send struct (never a byte-image
//!    ritual). The leader-unwind containment that DestroyParallelContext's
//!    private-shutdown hook provided is an RAII join guard in the engage
//!    frame. The DSM-shaped path is untouched for REAL parallel
//!    engagements.
//! 3. INLINE-EXECUTE DEFAULT (`PGRUST_STMT_TASK_INLINE`, default ON under
//!    the master knob; `0`/`off` kills): survey rule 1 (Cilk work-first;
//!    Go rejected handoff-with-wakeup; run-on-arrival is the default). If
//!    a pool seat is free WITHOUT WAITING (`Runtime::try_borrow_seat`),
//!    the session thread executes the statement ITSELF through the
//!    incumbent per-tuple loop — literally the same code, with the seat
//!    held for governed accounting — and no submission, no wake, no bind,
//!    no funnel exists. Cancel identity on this path IS the incumbent
//!    path's (CFI raises on the session thread). Enqueue+wake happens
//!    ONLY under contention (no free seat).
//! 4. SPINNER-COUNT WAKE ELISION (`PGRUST_POOL_WAKE_SPINNER`, default OFF,
//!    pool-wide): survey rule 2 (Go nmspinning/wakep) — the pool's
//!    new-work submission wake becomes epoch-bump + spinner check; notify
//!    only when no searcher covers the work, and then exactly ONE idle
//!    worker in LIFO order with the 3-poll starvation cap (survey rule 4).
//!    Lives in `pgsync::ParkLot` / `runtime::sched`, not here; the enqueue
//!    path rides it when armed.
//!
//! The engaged/inline trace lines carry `unparks=<delta>` (the wakeup
//! program's unparks-per-statement metric, survey rule 6): the leader
//! reads the pool park lot's unpark counter around its own ceremony.

// GL-STMTTASK-2 QUANTUM-YIELD EXPERIMENT (Michael-chartered via the

// cheapest flavor: reuse the permit-donation shape; no stack switching,
// the thread stays put). On each CFI inside an armed statement-task span
// (inline seat on the session thread, or the dop-1 drive on a worker —
// both hold exactly one execution permit): if the quantum expired AND
// someone is actually waiting (a priority-lane waiter or live interactive
// QoS demand), release the permit and reacquire it through the ORDINARY
// lane — interactive acquirers overtake (Semaphore::acquire defers to the
// priority lane), so a serial flood stops head-of-line-blocking sub-floor
// needles. Skips inside declared blocking sections (the permit is already
// donated there — double-release guard). Rationale vs stackful
// suspension: donation restores capacity without any continuation
// machinery; only if the fleet scenario says donation cannot restore the
// needle p95 does the bigger hammer get argued.
//
// Knobs: PGRUST_STMT_TASK_YIELD (arm, exact 1|on, DEFAULT OFF — an
// experiment posture, not a flip) and PGRUST_STMT_TASK_YIELD_US (quantum,
// default 1000µs — a placeholder pending the coordinator's calibration
// sweep; the ladder sweeps it).
//
// Known edge (documented): the reacquire is a plain semaphore wait —
// cancel delivered mid-yield is observed only after the permit returns
// (bounded by the pool's morsel/statement cadence; the SerialLeaseYield
// re-acquire has the same shape). CFI-cadence starvation edge: a
// statement body that never passes a CFI site never yields — the known
// class is the same one cancel already cannot reach (the inc-1 SRF-fill
// hole was exactly this and was fixed by adding the C-parity CFI); no
// other unbounded CFI-less stretch is known.
