//! EA-ON-MORSELS instrumentation partials (docs/design/ea-morsels.md §2).
//!
//! One `InstrumentPartial` per (worker, task set), living exactly where the
//! arm's RESULT partials live and obeying the same three disciplines: no
//! shared counters on any hot path (each worker owns its partial; tallies
//! are claim/window-grain); export on the worker's own claim boundary
//! (cumulative overwrite — decision-6, so the final export precedes the
//! settle); generation keying inherited from the channel it rides (an
//! aborted attempt's partials are never merged — the arms read them only on
//! a clean Completed outcome, the runtime_partial.rs invariant).
//!
//! EXACTNESS CONTRACT (runtime-dop1-tax coordination, ea-morsels.md §2):
//! these counters are EXACT, never sampled — they accumulate in the
//! worker's local state and export at claim end, which stays exact under
//! the dop1-tax delta-export scheme by construction. Sampled metering
//! (their fix-5) applies to WFIN/stderr observability only.
//!
//! Dead-when-off: nothing in this module runs unless the engagement was
//! admitted WITH instrumentation (`es_instrument != 0`); the fold drain's
//! tallies are compiled out of the serial instantiation entirely (const-
//! generic `EA=false` — the off-path audit's strongest form).
