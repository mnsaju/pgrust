//! Lane-v2 engagement/refusal accounting — the substrate of the lane honesty
//! gates (design doc "Definition of complete": engagement floor +
//! assert-refuse allowlist; `scripts/lane-gates.sh`).
//!
//! Structure: one process-global relaxed-atomic counter per (shape class) for
//! OWNED decisions, and per (shape class × refusal reason) for REFUSED
//! decisions. Backends are threads of one process here, so the totals
//! aggregate across all backends for free.
//!
//! Tick semantics (documented per class; the gate's floor file restates them):
//!   * `SeqScan` — one tick per memoized static verdict (≈ one per scan node
//!     per (re)init), plus per-call ticks for the dynamic EPQ/backward gates
//!     (which run before the memo and are rare).
//!   * `IndexScan` / `IndexOnlyScan` / `BitmapHeapScan` — the fusibility check
//!     is per `exec_proc_node` call (not node-memoized), so owned/refused
//!     ticks are per-pull decisions. Counts are large but deterministic for a
//!     fixed corpus.
//!   * `AggBuild` — one OWNED tick per lane-owned agg feed event: a hash-agg
//!     build (the drain-the-scan-pipeline event), a plain-agg fold drive, or
//!     a sorted-agg stream start over a sort feed (index-order-fed sorted
//!     streams have no build event; their engagement ticks under the
//!     per-pull index classes as feed decisions). Refusals per offered call.
//!   * `SortFeed` — one OWNED tick per lane-owned sort feed; structural
//!     refusals once per memoized verdict; dynamic EPQ/backward per call.
//!   * `Join` — one OWNED tick per lane-owned join build event; structural
//!     refusals once per memoized verdict; dynamic EPQ/backward,
//!     fused-probe-drive economics, and multi-batch spill refusals per call.
//!   * `NestLoop` — one OWNED tick per accepted outer row (the unit the lane
//!     owns: bind params → rescan the inner → drain the expansion);
//!     structural refusals once per memoized verdict; dynamic EPQ/backward
//!     per call.
//!   * `Group` — one OWNED tick per lane-owned group-over-sort drive start
//!     (the underlying sort-feed event); refusals per offered call (the
//!     child-Sort verdict itself is memoized on the Sort node, so the
//!     per-call cascade is one flag load).
//!   * `ResultNode` — one OWNED tick per lane-owned Result execution (the
//!     no-FROM row / one-time-gate consumption, or the child feed event);
//!     refusals per offered call.
//!   * `SubqueryScan` — one OWNED tick per lane-owned feed event (the
//!     child sort feed for the bare hook; the agg build event for the
//!     agg-over-subquery composition); refusals per offered call.
//!   * `Append` — one OWNED tick per memoized structural verdict (per Append
//!     node per (re)init, like the seqscan class); structural child refusals
//!     once per memoized verdict, dynamic EPQ/backward/parallel gates per
//!     offered call.
//!   * `ProjectSet` — at default config never owned (the documented
//!     wholesale refuse, design §4): one REFUSED tick per offered call,
//!     unchanged. With the default-OFF `PGRUST_LANE_V2_ROWMODE` knob ON
//!     (Phase-0 row-mode facility, rowmode.rs), the admitted
//!     `ProjectSet ← childless Result` shape ticks OWNED once per offered
//!     pull the row-mode drive owns (the per-pull decision cadence of the
//!     index classes); refusals stay per offered call. NOTE for a future
//!     default flip: ProjectSet compositions then bypass `result_arm`, so
//!     the `result` class's owned floor must be reseeded alongside the
//!     `projectset` one (see notes/ws-e-rowmode-ledger.md).
//!
//! Overhead: with the lane OFF nothing here ever runs (the dispatch hooks gate
//! on `lanev2::enabled()` before any lane code). With the lane ON but
//! accounting disarmed (no `PGRUST_LANE_V2_STATS`), every tick is one cached
//! pointer load + branch. With accounting armed it is additionally one relaxed
//! `fetch_add` per lane-path decision — decisions, not rows (except the
//! per-pull index/IOS/bitmap classes noted above, which are exactly as
//! frequent as the fusibility checks the lane already runs there).
//!
//! Reporting: `PGRUST_LANE_V2_STATS=<dir>` arms the accounting; each backend
//! thread that ticked at least once dumps the *cumulative process-wide*
//! totals to `<dir>/lane-v2-stats.<pid>.tsv` when the thread exits (a TLS
//! drop guard — no exit-hook wiring, no new GUC, no change to `pg_settings`
//! byte-identity). Dumps overwrite atomically (tmp + rename) under a mutex,
//! so the last backend to exit leaves the final totals; the harness sums
//! across files (one per server *process*, i.e. per resume segment). NOT a
//! GUC by design — see the module doc of `lanev2` on `pg_settings`
//! byte-identity.
