//! WindowAgg lane hosting over the sort breaker — single-executor Phase 1,
//! WS-H inc-1 (contract §2c/§5; design worklog notes/se-ws-h-windows.md).
//!
//! Increment-1 admits the W1 class only: `WindowAgg(frameOptions ==
//! FRAMEOPTION_DEFAULTS)` over `Sort` over a lane-fusible SCAN child (the
//! shared `sort_lane_fusible_memo` verdict, further restricted to scan
//! feeds — Agg-fed sorts refuse structurally because their feed carries
//! the lane's ONE dynamic feed-time refuse, which sticky ownership cannot
//! host; see `window_refuse_reason`), every window function in {row_number,
//! rank, dense_rank, plain default-frame aggregates on the node's compiled
//! evaltrans}, no runCondition, no qual, non-EPQ, forward, no row marks,
//! first-pull-fresh node. Everything else refuses to the byte-identical
//! Volcano `exec_window_agg` path.
//!
//! Control shape: `pull_step_chain(sort, SortEmitSourceCfi, SortEmit,
//! WindowOp, RootAdapter)` — the try_own_group wiring over the sort
//! read-back, with `SortEmitSourceCfi` replaying the row engine's per-fetch
//! ExecSort entry CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS (exec_window_agg's spool loop enters
//! the child once per row). ALL window semantics live in the node crate's
//! seams (`nodewindowagg::lane`); the lane owns only control flow.
//!
//! STICKY OWNERSHIP: a partition-buffered lane drive holds cross-call state
//! `exec_window_agg` cannot resume (unlike Group/SortedAgg, whose node state
//! IS the Volcano state), so ownership is all-or-nothing per (re)scan: once
//! `w.lane` exists the lane drives unconditionally, and a dynamic-gate flip
//! (EPQ engaging mid-stream, a backward pull) raises a LOUD PgError — never
//! a silent wrong-results fallback. The flip is made unreachable by
//! construction through the STRUCTURAL row-marks gate (es_rowmarks non-empty
//! refuses admission — EPQ's substrate; ruled in the Phase-1 contract, WS-H
//! amendment 4); the loud tripwire stays as defense-in-depth, and a fired
//! tripwire in any test is a release blocker for the knob.
//!
//! Default OFF behind `PGRUST_LANE_V2_WINDOWS` (contract R-KNOBS §1): the
//! OFF path runs ZERO lane code and ticks NOTHING (no pre-existing WindowAgg
//! wholesale refuse exists, so default-config lane-gates accounting is
//! byte-identical by construction; floor seeding is flip-time work).
//!
//! WAVE 2 (WS-M): tier-2 windows behind the separate `PGRUST_LANE_V2_
//! WINDOWS_T2` knob (wave-2 contract §2 — a distinct flip rung from W1 with
//! independent gates). Increment-1 is **T2-A**: the WindowAgg node as a
//! row-mode delegation LEAF (`WindowAggRowSource` → `PassthroughOp` →
//! `RootAdapter` under `pull_step_rows` — the WS-G MergeJoin template),
//! `next_row` a pure delegation to the ported `exec_window_agg` with the
//! child Volcano-driven inside it. T2-A therefore admits EVERY WindowAgg
//! shape the row engine itself runs — explicit ROWS/RANGE/GROUPS frames
//! with all bound types, EXCLUDE, lead/lag/first/last/nth_value, FILTER,
//! runCondition/pass-through, multiple window defs (stacked WindowAgg
//! nodes host independently), inverse transitions — and inherits the row
//! engine's posture BY CONSTRUCTION (contract §6 WS-M amendment 3): all
//! cross-call state is the node's own `WindowAggStateData`, the lane holds
//! ZERO shadow state, so a Volcano fallback at ANY pull boundary (EPQ /
//! backward / instrumented per-pull gates) resumes byte-identically.
//! Unlike W1 there is NO sticky ownership and NO structural admission —
//! ownership is decided per pull (pull ≡ drive for row-mode hosts).
//!
//! T2 tick cadence (contract §3.3, adjudicating WS-M OQ5): the row-mode
//! law — OWNED once per owned PULL (the WS-G cadence). W1 keeps its sticky
//! batch-drive cadence — once per drive start. Both mechanisms REUSE
//! `ShapeClass::WindowAgg` (= 20; wave-2 vocab commit) — mechanism
//! attribution lives in the EngineEvent detail string ("w1-batch" vs
//! "t2-rowmode"), never a second class (contract §1). Corollary,
//! documented for the gate harnesses: with BOTH knobs ON, a pull refused
//! by both hooks (EPQ/backward) ticks the shared class ONCE PER HOOK; at
//! default config both knobs are OFF and the class stays silent.
//!
//! Hook order in `procnode::window_agg_arm`: W1 first (sticky owner wins
//! its admitted shapes), T2-A second on W1 refuse — so with both knobs ON,
//! W1 drives the default-frame batch lane and T2 hosts the refused
//! remainder; with only T2 ON the delegation hosts everything.
//!
//! WAVE 3 (WS-R): **T2-B** — the sealed FRAMED batch drive behind the
//! separate `PGRUST_LANE_V2_WINDOWS_T2B` knob (wave-3 contract §2.1/§6.R; an
//! independent flip rung; the T2-A delegation knob's behavior is unchanged
//! at both of its arms). T2-B generalizes the W1 machine to explicit frames
//! by driving the NODE'S OWN framed machinery over a lane-buffered partition
//! (`nodewindowagg::lane` T2-B section): same control shape as W1
//! (`pull_step_chain(sort, SortEmitSourceCfi, SortEmit, FramedWindowOp,
//! RootAdapter)`, sort-over-scan feeds only), STICKY ownership with the same
//! loud tripwire, structural admission = W1's child gates + the framed shape
//! seal (no runCondition, no qual — the pass-through family stays on T2-A).
//! Hook order becomes W1 → T2-B → T2-A: W1 keeps its default-frame shapes,
//! T2-B batch-hosts the framed (and W1-refused default-frame) remainder over
//! admitted sort feeds, T2-A delegation hosts everything else. Tick cadence:
//! T2-B is a sticky batch drive — OWNED once per drive start (the W1
//! cadence), refusals once per memoized verdict; the shared class stays
//! `ShapeClass::WindowAgg` with mechanism detail "t2b-framed" (contract §1.2:
//! zero new vocabulary).
