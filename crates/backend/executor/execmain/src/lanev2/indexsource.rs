//! Index scans as lane sources — single-executor migration Phase 1, WS-F
//! increment 1: the IndexOnlyScan hosted behind the storage seam
//! ([`super::batch_source::BatchGranuleSource`]), SERIAL, behind
//! `PGRUST_LANE_V2_INDEXSOURCE` (default ON since the SE17-GATES flip; explicit
//! `=0`/`off` = permanent kill restoring the WS-F inc-1 arm-owned world).
//! Everything here is byte-identical between the arms (the lane's 5-arm ISO
//! effigy + 6-cell dualexec + C-oracle proof): knob OFF, the procnode
//! `agg_arm` hook falls straight through to the UNCHANGED fused
//! `exec_agg_batched` drive; knob ON, the drive is the SAME
//! `exec_agg_batched` loop over the SAME node primitives
//! (`index_only_scan_batch_next` / `index_only_scan_batch_store` — the
//! VM-probe / heap-fallback / predicate-lock order preserved verbatim), now
//! routed through the seam with ownership ticks, trace lines and the
//! EXPLAIN (ENGINE) production-verdict mirror at this one chokepoint.
//!
//! # The index-source posture law (integration contract §2a(iii))
//!
//! Index sources are POSITIONAL (mode B): `position()` is a real seek by
//! key-range subrange (`bt_partition_scan_range` on the index-morsels
//! branch is the substrate), and the sequential seize-cursor posture is
//! confined to the runtime arm's private drive. Increment 1 is dop-1: the
//! two postures degenerate identically to ONE whole-range claim + drain,
//! and [`IndexOnlyScanSource::position`] therefore accepts exactly one
//! whole-range claim per scan and ERRORS on any other range — fail-closed
//! until a width posture is ratified for a later increment.
//!
//! # Width posture: IOS is serial BY EVIDENCE, not by omission
//!
//! The index-morsels lane's MODE RACE (notes/index-morsels-lane.md,
//! CONFIRM-green 2026-07-15) measured index-ONLY-scan morselization at
//! 0.42–0.51x (a REGRESSION) at 1M/10M in every mode, hot and cold — the
//! serial leaf walk is fast and morsel ceremony dominates — while
//! heap-fetch IndexScan fold shapes won 4.6–6.1x at dop8. Boarding action
//! ratified by the reconciler (contract Q1): IOS parallel width is REFUSED
//! by default; the 6.1x heap-fetch class arrives by ABSORBING the
//! index-morsels branch (inc-3), never by re-implementing it here.
//!
//! SE-AGGIOS clarification: admitting PLANNER-parallel worker fragments
//! ([`INDEXSOURCE_PAR`] point 1) does NOT contradict this evidence. The
//! mode race priced LANE-initiated morsel width (the lane splitting one
//! serial scan). A stock `Partial Aggregate <- Parallel Index Only Scan`
//! fragment is the PLANNER's width: each worker's feed stays dop-1 over
//! the AM's shared page cursor — exactly the drive the fused arm #3 runs
//! on those fragments today (its gate never had a parallel check).
//!
//! # Accounting (knob-OFF = today's accounting, contract §7)
//!
//! Knob OFF this module ticks NOTHING (no EnvOff: the fused arm owns the
//! shape exactly as today and today's accounting at this arm is exactly the
//! sorted-agg hook's — any OFF-path tick would drift the default floors).
//! Knob ON: one OWNED tick under `ShapeClass::IndexOnlyScan` per lane-owned
//! feed event (the granule-map + position + drive ceremony; retrieve-phase
//! pulls of a filled hash agg run zero seam code and tick nothing), child
//! refusals per offered pull under `IndexOnlyScan` (the class's per-pull
//! cadence), the admission floor under `TinyInputFloor`. The agg-side gate
//! falls through SILENTLY: the sorted-agg hook ahead of this one already
//! ticks `AggBuild`/`AggNotDrainable` per offered pull at this same arm, so
//! ticking it again here would double-count. R-VOCAB untouched: no new
//! ShapeClass, no new RefuseReason.
//!
//! # EXPLAIN (ENGINE) mirror (contract §2e) and its inc-1 reachability gap
//!
//! `engine_record_verdict` is wired at this chokepoint (owned and refused
//! verdicts both). KNOWN GAP, ledgered (notes/se-ws-f-indexsource.md):
//! under EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, ENGINE) every child is an `Instrumented`
//! wrapper, so procnode's concrete `IndexOnlyScan` agg-arm match — where
//! this hook lives — is not reached; the recorded IOS verdict today comes
//! from the standalone `try_own_index_only_scan` hook. Capture breadth for
//! the agg-over-IOS composition is WS-C inc-2's D3 ledger item 2 (the
//! reconciler's Q5 ruling: coordinate, don't duplicate) — when WS-C's
//! breadth pass offers the wrapped shape, the mirror here is already live.
//!
//! # Later increments (designed, NOT built — see the WS-F ledger)
//!
//! inc-2: page-batch leaf staging (`index_only_scan_stage_leaf_run`) and
//! push-pipeline hosting; inc-3: absorption of the index-morsels branch
//! (heap-fetch IndexScan fold shapes, the race-proven 6.1x class) with the
//! tail-drain-to-Done completion law as an invariant + churn e2e leg and an
//! explicit SAOP width refusal; inc-4: BitmapHeapSource over the frozen
//! shared bitmap. Runtime keys stay refused until the increments rebase
//! onto the t25 subplankey fix (`exec_eval_expr_with_subplans` routing;
//! SubPlan-bearing keys never parallel).

// --- WS-AE (wave-8): agg-over-IndexScan feed (AGG_INDEX arm re-earn) ----------
//
// Lane PLAIN + HASHED agg feeds over IndexScan order — the fused arm #2
// (`PGRUST_FUSED_ARM_AGG_INDEX`, procnode.rs) surface, hosted behind the
// storage seam exactly as WS-F hosted arm #3 (agg-over-IndexOnlyScan) above.
// Charter: SE-LETTERS banked arm #2 as the WIDEST measured OFF gap
// (+10.20% instr / +7.21% wall, NOT CLOCK-STARTABLE) because the lane
// sorted-agg hook admits only `agg_sorted_lane_admissible` (AGG_SORTED)
// shapes — PLAIN/HASHED refuse (AggNotDrainable) and NO lane replacement
// exists. This feed is the replacement: knob ON, the drive is the SAME
// `exec_agg_batched` loop over the SAME node primitives as the fused arm
// (`index_scan_next_tidrun` / `index_scan_batch_fetch` — same-block TID
// runs; per-TID heap fetch resolves visibility, so `storeless_ok` is FALSE,
// the HOT-chain/dead-row law the fused `IndexScanBatchSource` states), now
// routed through [`BatchGranuleSource`] with ownership ticks and traces at
// this one chokepoint. Knob `PGRUST_LANE_V2_AGG_INDEXFEED`, default ON
// since the SE8-GATES AE2 flip (re-earn letter flat at +0.047%; explicit
// `=0`/`off` = permanent kill switch restoring the fused arm); OFF path =
// one cached-bool test (knob-OFF-zero-cost idiom, wave-8 law 4).
//
// Posture: identical to [`IndexOnlyScanSource`] — POSITIONAL (mode B),
// dop-1, exactly one whole-range claim per scan (`validate_serial_claim`
// reused verbatim); granule = index-leaf pacing quantum, published as an
// UPPER-BOUND block-count estimate (pacing only; the drain runs to the AM's
// own exhaustion). IOS parallel-width evidence (module doc above) carries:
// no width posture here until ratified.
//
// Accounting (mirrors the WS-F contract §7 posture): knob OFF this feed
// ticks NOTHING (the fused arm owns the shape exactly as today; an OFF tick
// would drift the default floors). Knob ON: one OWNED tick under
// `ShapeClass::IndexScan` per lane-owned feed event (under a parallel-aware
// scan: one per WORKER feed — N feed events exist); child refusals per
// offered pull under `IndexScan` (`index_scan_refuse_reason_ex` — the AE2
// set with the parallel-aware row admitted under the AGGIDX-PAR increment;
// the class's per-pull cadence). The agg-side gate falls through SILENTLY:
// the sorted-agg hook ahead of this one already ticked
// AggBuild/AggNotDrainable for this offer. R-VOCAB untouched: no new
// ShapeClass, no new RefuseReason.
//
// No admission floor in inc-1, RECORDED: `IndexScanState` retains no
// planner row estimate (the IOS floor reads `plan_rows`, a field
// nodeindexonlyscan stored for WS-F; nodeindexscan is outside WS-AE's
// ownership rows this wave), and the WS-F floor's inc-1 default is 0 =
// never refuses — so shipping floorless is behaviorally identical to the
// precedent. The floor becomes load-bearing only when staging/width costs
// appear; adding the `plan_rows` mirror is a one-line init-site escalation
// for that increment (notes/se-wave8-aggindex.md).
