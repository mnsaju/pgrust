//! M1 RUNTIME SCAN PIPELINES — the first real pipeline on the morsel
//! runtime (docs/design/parallelism-redesign-2026-07.md §2.1/§2.2/§5-M1).
//!
//! Shape: a SERIAL-plan plain Agg over a pgrcolumnar OR heap SeqScan
//! (COUNT/plain-agg fold shapes with optional PREWHERE/kernel quals — the
//! lane's simplest fold pipelines), executed as ONE runtime TaskSet at DOP
//! N. The morsel source is [`runtime::GranuleMapSource`] over the geometry
//! the storage seam publishes ([`super::batch_source::SeqScanSource`]):
//! pgrcolumnar granules with row-group hard boundaries, or heap block
//! ranges with none (C's table_block_parallelscan_nextpage chunked claim,
//! runtime-adaptive).
//! Heap visibility is per tuple inside the page batch, under the leader
//! snapshot the task binding restores — exactly a C parallel seq scan
//! worker's check. The plan surface
//! stays the serial plan (force-plans discipline: EXPLAIN unchanged, no
//! planner change); engagement is FORCED/explicit:
//!
//!   PGRUST_RUNTIME=1  (pool spawned at postmaster start, M0 kill switch)
//!   SET pgrust.runtime_scan_pool = <dop>   (arming, runtime_pool.rs)
//!
//! Execution model (submit-and-park, §2.5):
//!  * The LEADER creates a parallel context (vacuumparallel precedent — no
//!    Gather node), installs the query-task binding policy, submits a
//!    PINNED resource group (one task set: the GranuleMapSource + the fold
//!    work), launches N helpers through the ordinary wpool machinery, and
//!    PARKS — a WaitForParallelWorkersToFinish-shaped loop (completion poll
//!    + ProcessParallelMessages + CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS + latch quantum).
//!  * Each HELPER runs a trivial entry task, and at POST_TASK_PARK — the
//!    hook reserved for exactly this ("the runtime pool/scheduler lane owns
//!    the production park") — binds the query's state through the
//!    QUERY-TASK BINDER (`parallel::with_query_task_binding`, its first
//!    production caller; fail-closed: anything the binder refuses simply
//!    does not participate) and drives the pinned RG's morsels through the
//!    runtime (`Runtime::drive_pinned`): duration-adaptive granule claims,
//!    photo-finish shutdown, last-worker-out finalization.
//!  * Each morsel = a whole-granule range inside one row group (=dict
//!    epoch); the helper positions its own scan (`set_granule_range`) and
//!    re-enters the UNCHANGED serial fold drain (`agg_plain_fold_drain`).
//!  * Partials are exported after EVERY morsel into the worker's slot
//!    (overwrite; export is a few pergroup reads) — so by the time the RG
//!    completes, every contributing worker's FINAL state is installed (its
//!    last export happened inside its last task, before its settle).
//!  * The leader absorbs the combined partial (order-insensitive-exact
//!    kinds only, nodeagg::runtime_partial) and runs the ordinary plain
//!    finalize — output rows byte-identical to the serial arm.
//!
//! Fail-closed admission (refuse ⇒ fall through to the serial fold arm,
//! byte-identically): fold-classified plan with no residual transitions and
//! whitelisted kinds only; no params (extern or exec); binder policy
//! sources empty (no temp namespace, not serializable, no pending invals);
//! parallel-safe scan expressions; MVCC snapshot; not already in parallel
//! mode / a parallel worker; a pgrcolumnar or plain heap scan admitted by the
//! lane gate; fold-mode shapes prove the fold prefix arms on the leader;
//! first-class dynamic gates (EPQ / instrumented / backward) via
//! `seq_scan_fusible`. If every launched helper refuses the bind before
//! any granule is claimed, the leader aborts the (untouched) RG and falls
//! back to the serial arm — engagement can only produce the serial answer
//! or a real error, never a partial one.
