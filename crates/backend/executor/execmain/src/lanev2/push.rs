//! Push control-model skeleton for lane-executor-v2 (design §Architecture 1).
//!
//! The lane pipeline is a **push island with a pull adapter at its root**:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Source ──batch──▶ Operator (…chain…) ──tuple──▶ Sink (RootAdapter)
//!      ▲                                                    │ buffers ≤ 1 tuple
//!      └──────────── pipeline driver (pull_step) ◀──────────┘
//!                              ▲
//!                PG's Volcano executor pulls one tuple
//!                per `exec_proc_node` call
//! ```
//!
//! Control flows *forward* (push): the driver pulls a batch from the source
//! and pushes it through the operator chain into the sink; operators never
//! pull from a child. PostgreSQL's executor stays Volcano/pull, so the
//! pipeline ROOT presents a pull face to PG: a capacity-one buffer the
//! pipeline fills and `exec_proc_node` drains, one tuple per call.
//!
//! Why capacity one: byte-identity. The per-tuple path resets the node's
//! per-tuple expression context before evaluating each row's qual/projection,
//! so at most one produced tuple is ever live; buffering more would (a) reset
//! the context under the parent's view of the current tuple and (b) evaluate
//! quals/projections on rows the per-tuple path would never reach (LIMIT /
//! error-in-order / volatile-qual invocation counts). The `SinkFeed::Full`
//! backpressure signal makes the push pipeline exactly as lazy as the pull
//! drive it replaces: same primitive calls, same order, same per-row
//! semantics — ONLY the control model (who calls whom) changes.
//!
//! Cross-call state (the staged batch + consume position) stays node-resident
//! (`lane_cursor`), surviving the Volcano call boundary; the pipeline stage
//! objects are stateless and reassembled per call (free — they are unit
//! structs). One `&mut` executor node exists, so the driver owns it and
//! threads it into each stage call (`Source::Node`/`Operator::Node`).

// seam (`execmain.rs::execute_plan`) computes it here and writes the field
// UNCONDITIONALLY at run entry, so the budget is per-run by construction,

//
// ENFORCEMENT HONESTY (recorded, not hidden): the capacity-one `RootAdapter`
// already pauses the pipeline after EVERY emitted tuple (`SinkFeed::Full` →
// `OpStatus::Paused`, position node-resident), and the run loop above
// (`execute_plan`'s `number_tuples` check — C's own ExecutePlan enforcement)
// stops the drive at exactly N pulls. Budget-zero ⇒ Paused is therefore
// STRUCTURAL today: no per-accept budget decrement is wired in inc-1
// (a per-tuple field test on the knob-OFF hot path would break the
// instruction-invisibility law for zero behavior). The installed budget is
// the cross-module signal the park/settle glue (§2, inc-1b) and the
// single-executor push-drive endgame read; when the emit face is driven as
// a push sink (capacity > 1), the decrement moves INTO `RootAdapter::accept`

// --- WS-AI wave-9.5 (cursors inc-1b): the §2 park shape -------------------------
//
// Design (lane-cursors.md §2, DECIDED): at suspension, SETTLE everything;
// repossess on resume. The budget-N emit sink (inc-1a) is the settle POINT:
// when a budgeted run returns to the protocol layer, `cursor_run_park`
// (below the drive loop in `execute_plan`) walks the plan tree and settles
// every lane-staged scan claim through the ledgered claim-release chain —
// `seq_scan_cursor_settle` → `table_scan_end_claim_release` →
// `heap_end_claim_release` — with the reposition point recorded
// node-resident (`SeqScanState::lane_park`). R3 ZERO-PINS-AT-SETTLE is
// debug-asserted at every settled claim. The next run's entry
// (`cursor_park_resume`) restages the suspended page batch and restores the
// consume cursor BEFORE the first pull touches staged state — re-entry costs
// the emit-face hop + one buffer re-lookup, never translate/verdict/compile
// (the §8 explicit-FETCH guard's bar).
//
// WHAT CAN ACTUALLY BE STAGED AT SUSPENSION (audited at inc-1b, recorded in
// notes/se-wave9-ai.md): `HeapBatchSource` claims are DRAIN-SCOPED (both
// construction sites settle via `end_claim` inside one exec_proc_node call
// — they can never span a suspension); breaker pipelines (agg/sort/join
// builds) consume their input whole at first pull, so post-build suspension
// holds zero scan claims; the per-pull staged shapes are the standalone
// scan pipeline's page batch (heap arm: ONE pinned page, rs_cbuf — the
// claim this walker settles; production standalone admission is
// pgrcolumnar-only today, whose staged windows are Arc/mmap-backed decode
// scratch under R4 — no bufmgr pins, nothing to release, node-resident by
// design §1). Ledger: a budgeted run is DOP-1 caller-as-worker (§3) —
// pool-invisible, zero ledger width to retire.
//
// STATED DIVERGENCE carried (design §2): C keeps rs_cbuf pinned across
// FETCHes; the settled lane claim does not. Pin-visible/pgstat only, never
// output bytes; priced by the §8 cadence pairs. The VOLCANO scan's own
// cross-FETCH pin is C parity and is deliberately NOT touched (the walker
// settles only lane-STAGED batches, `lane_n > 0`).

/// The run seam's settle half: walk + settle + the `cursor-plan-refused`
/// roll-up tick. Returns true iff anything parked (the caller then sets
/// `es_lane_cursor_parked`). Runs only on budgeted runs (caller gates on
/// `es_cursor_run_budget.is_some()`); refuses under EPQ (the budget belongs
/// to the outer run — inc-1a §5 EPQ law, pinned in units).

// --- WS-AJ wave-9.5 (SPI Stage-A seam, `se/spi-stage-a`; lane-spi.md §1/§3) -----
//
// Stage A of docs/design/lane-spi.md: `_SPI_pquery` runs a statement as
// executor_start → ONE `executor_run(Forward, tcount, dest)`
// (spi/src/execute.rs:562) → executor_finish/end — the tcount limit is the
// SAME count-exact stop the cursor budget carries. TWO producers reach this
// seam with a count-limited `CommandDest::Spi` run (review re-baseline,
// notes/se-spi-stage-a.md §8 — the original STOP-ONLY premise named only
// the first and was falsified by live evidence):
//   1. `_SPI_pquery` itself — STOP-then-END cadence (executor_finish/end
//      follow immediately; the spi_inc1_aj_w9 unit pins freeze it).
//   2. `SPI_cursor_fetch` / `SPI_scroll_cursor_fetch`
//      (spi/src/cursor.rs:203) → `PortalRunFetch` → `PortalRunSelect`,
//      which threads the per-fetch SPI receiver into `executor_run`
//      (pquery/src/lib.rs:594-630) on the SAME QueryDesc/estate — every
//      plpgsql FOR loop (exec_for_query: fetch 10 then 50 per call) is a
//      stream of count-limited Spi-dest runs that RESUME.
// The seam therefore rides WS-AI's budget-sink SHAPE — an estate-resident
// per-run budget (`es_spi_run_budget`, its own field so the two taxonomies
// never cross) installed at the `execute_plan` run seam — settles
// lane-staged claims at the count-limited stop with the SAME ParkWalk
// release chain, AND arms the SAME resume signal the cursor walker owns
// (`es_lane_cursor_parked` → the entry-side `cursor_park_resume` walk):
// producer 2's next fetch repossesses exactly like a cursor FETCH; for
// producer 1 the armed flag is estate-resident dead state torn down by the
// immediately-following ExecutorEnd (the same parked-then-close path a
// partially-fetched cursor already rides under WS-AI).
//
// spi.c PROVENANCE, BINDING (the wave-9.5 review's attack list):
//   * `SPI_processed` = `es_processed` read after the single run
//     (execute.rs:563) — the budget changes NOTHING about the drive loop's
//     count enforcement (C's own ExecutePlan `number_tuples` check), so the
//     count is byte-preserved BY CONSTRUCTION (pins: tcount-exact stop,
//     tcount=0 completeness, tcount>rows saturation).
//   * tuptable lifetime / `SPI_freetuptable` timing: the tuptable is built
//     by the SpiPrintTup receiver ABOVE this seam and owned by the SPI
//     connection stack; nothing here touches it.
//   * connect/finish nesting: each nested SPI statement runs on its OWN
//     QueryDesc/estate (fresh `es_spi_run_budget` written at ITS run entry;
//     the unconditional-overwrite idiom makes the field per-run by
//     construction), so nesting cannot leak a budget across levels.
//   * rewind / EXCEPTION-block unwind mid-SPI: an error unwind abandons the
//     estate without re-entry; the budget is estate-resident dead state
//     (no guard needed — the WS-AI unwind argument verbatim), and staged
//     lane claims release through the normal executor/resowner teardown.
//   * INVARIANT 5 (teardown ordering, post-t26 map per notes/se-wave9-aj.md
//     §11.3): the settle retires lane-staged claims at the stop point,
//     BEFORE executor_finish/end return control toward the three
//     plancache release points (per-eval put-back on invalidation-replan,
//     `free_function_plans`, the `on_proc_exit` release path).
//
// INVARIANT 1 (never route detected-simple): the plpgsql simple path
// evaluates via ExprState off the function-lifetime plan cache with no
// ExecutorStart/Run — it can never reach this seam; nothing here can demote
// it (the rate + Ir/call guard pair is fleet evidence — named obligation
// `aj-ir-pair` in the worklog, the ai-ir-pair cadence).
//
// INVARIANT 3 (thread-affinity LAW), seam-side half: a budgeted SPI run is
// DOP-1 caller-as-worker BY CONSTRUCTION — count-limited runs never carry a
// gang (the ported execmain.rs use_parallel_mode gate), and the classifier
// FAIL-CLOSED refuses a parallel run (ParallelGate) rather than asserting.
// The plpgsql-side owner of the law is the function-lifetime `EXPR_PLANS`
// SimpleState machinery (the RV3 re-baseline, se-wave9-aj.md §11.3) — a
// frozen surface this increment; the owner-side debug assertion lands with
// t26 absorption (named obligation in the worklog).

// --- WS-CB wave-10 (cursors inc-2: the batch store fill; contract §2.1, band 95001+) ---
//
// The ratified fill shape: SCROLL/WITH-HOLD cursors are served from a
// portal-boundary tuplestore, and the store FILL is a lane-engine batch
// producer from day one — batches flow into the store WITHOUT the
// capacity-one per-row pull ceremony. `TuplestoreBatchSink` is the
// push-mode generalization the WS-AI enforcement-honesty note (above)
// names: when the emit face is driven as a push sink (capacity > 1), the
// per-accept budget decrement moves INTO the sink's `accept`, and
// `es_cursor_run_budget` is its source of truth.
//
// BYTE-IDENTITY BY IDENTITY, not reimplementation: `accept` hands each
// produced slot to the SAME `DestReceiver` the row-chain fill uses (the
// tuplestore receiver — `tuplestore::hold::puttupleslot` per row,
// detoast-on-append when armed; tstoreReceiver.c semantics), and carries
// the drive loop's own SELECT accounting (`es_processed += 1`). The store
// therefore receives the identical row stream in the identical order under
// either fill engine — the §2.3 fetch-invisibility gate's substrate.
//
// Park shape (§2.1, load-bearing): budget exhaustion mid-batch returns
// `SinkFeed::Full` ⇒ the operator saves its position NODE-RESIDENT and
// returns `OpStatus::Paused`; the run returns through `execute_plan`'s
// EXISTING wave-9.5 settle point (`cursor_run_park` — claims retire through
// the ledgered claim-release chain, R3 zero-pins-at-settle), and the next
// run's entry repossesses (`cursor_park_resume`). No new park machinery:
// the sink's pause is indistinguishable from the row-chain pause at the
// settle seam (batch_source.rs re-audit finding, worklog §1).
//
// EPQ + staleness pins (§2.1; WS-AI worklog §5 + §6 item 8, due here):
// the dispatch refuses under `es_epq_active` (an EPQ recheck drive inside
// a budgeted run must not read the outer run's budget) and the sink
// debug-asserts it per accept; the budget field is meaningful ONLY between
// `execute_plan` entry and return (the sink runs strictly inside that
