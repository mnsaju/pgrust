//! Row-mode read-side TAIL — wave-2 WS-L (the wave-2 integration contract
//! §1/§3/§4; design + WS-N seam spec in docs/design/rowmode-tail.md).
//!
//! Hosts the remaining read-side plan shapes as pure DELEGATION LEAVES.
//! Evolution of the hosting form (each step statement-identity-preserving):
//! wave-2 drove a per-shape `RowSource` through `pull_step_rows` over
//! `PassthroughOp` + `RootAdapter::new(None)`; se-delegtax SH-A collapsed
//! that pipeline to the degenerate `pull_step_point` driver (≡ a bare
//! `next_row`; proof in push.rs); se-delegtax SH-E then took the final
//! step: since the delegated `next_row` ran the IDENTICAL statements the
//! `procnode` arm's own fallback runs, ownership of a delegation leaf is
//! purely an ACCOUNTING fact — the arm now executes its single fallback
//! body on every pull (original Volcano tail-call shape), and this module
//! contributes the per-pull ownership VERDICT (gates + ticks + G7 capture)
//! as a side effect (`verdict` below). The `RowSource` bodies remain ONLY
//! for the six T3 shapes, whose tail_source.rs source form reuses them.
//! docs/design/rowmode-tail.md restates the byte-identity argument (one
//! `next_row` per owned pull ≡ one Volcano call per pull; zero lane-held
//! cross-call state; mark/restore and rescan enter through `execami`,
//! which the hosting never intercepted).
//!
//! Shapes (vocabulary in stats.rs, the one wave-2 vocab commit):
//! SubqueryScan (REUSES class 10), FunctionScan, TableFuncScan, ValuesScan,
//! SampleScan, TidScan, TidRangeScan, NamedTuplestoreScan, Material (inc-1);
//! CteScan, RecursiveUnion + WorkTableScan, Memoize (inc-2); SetOp,
//! MergeAppend, Unique, LockRows-without-EPQ (inc-3). ForeignScan is OUT of
//! wave 2 (Phase 3.4 ledger); Gather/GatherMerge are parallel-dispatch
//! nodes, excluded from the coverage denominator (contract §6-WS-L(2)).
//!
//! Knob: the existing `PGRUST_LANE_V2_ROWMODE` facility gate (default OFF;
//! contract §2 — NO per-shape sub-knobs; per-shape bisect is test-side only
//! via `ROWMODE_TAIL_OWNED_FOR_TESTS`). Knob-OFF ticks NOTHING for every
//! tail class: none of these shapes has a pre-existing wholesale refuse, so
//! default-config accounting stays byte-identical by construction (§2d).
//! MergeJoin is deliberately NOT here — it sits behind its own
//! `PGRUST_LANE_V2_MERGEJOIN` since the wave-2 knob-split commit
//! (rowmode.rs).
//!
//! Gate order (contract §3.2, exactly WS-G): knob (OFF = `Ok(None)`, ticks
//! nothing) → `es_epq_active` → Epq → `!forward` → Backward → instrumented →
//! Instrumented → shape gates (none: delegation is shape-agnostic) →
//! `tick_owned` ONCE → `pull_step_point`. OWNED cadence = once per drive
//! start = once per owned PG pull (§3.3; pull ≡ drive for row-mode). The
//! dynamic gates are OR-folded with the reason re-derived on a `#[cold]`
//! tail in the same priority order (se-delegtax SH-D) — set + cadence
//! identical.
//!
//! Shared-slot law (contract §3.8, binding here): no `RowSource` below
//! caches a shared-slot handle or read position across `next_row` calls.
//! Trivially satisfied: every delegation body re-enters the ported exec
//! function, which itself does the `es_worktable_shared` / CTE-shared
//! take-use-put-back per call (`exec_recursive_union`'s take/put around
//! every child call; `exec_work_table_scan` / `exec_cte_scan` resolving
//! their shared state per call).
//!
//! SubqueryScan + Unique COMPOSITION: those two arms already carry lane
//! hooks (the wave-4 streaming glue over the sort breaker). The glue keeps
//! priority — `lanev2.rs`'s `try_own_subquery_scan` / `try_own_unique` fall
//! through to `try_own_subquery_scan_tail` / `try_own_unique_tail` here when
//! the glue refuses, so the procnode arms stay single-hook and default
//! accounting is untouched (knob OFF the tail returns before any tick).
//! Knob-ON, an EPQ/backward offer may tick a class-10 refusal from the glue
//! AND one from the tail (two mechanisms, two offers) — documented in the
//! lane-gates.allowlist block.
