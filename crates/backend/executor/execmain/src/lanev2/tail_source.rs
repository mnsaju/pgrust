//! Tier-3 SOURCE-FORM hosting of the tail leaf shapes — wave-3 WS-Q
//! (`se/wave3-refusals`; wave-3 contract §6.Q; worklog
//! notes/se-ws-q-refusals.md).
//!
//! Where wave-2's rowmode_tail.rs hosts these shapes as pull-DELEGATION
//! leaves (`RowSource → PassthroughOp → RootAdapter` under
//! `pull_step_rows`), this module hosts the six Tier-2 tail LEAF shapes —
//! FunctionScan, TableFuncScan, SampleScan, TidScan, TidRangeScan,
//! NamedTuplestoreScan — as row-mode SOURCES: a `push::Source`/`Operator`
//! pair producing BATCH-SIZE-1 batches whose one staged row is the ported
//! exec body's own emitted slot. Exact PG per-row semantics BY CONSTRUCTION:
//! `produce` runs the identical `next_row` statement the delegation leaf
//! runs (one ported exec-body call per row — same qual/projection/interrupt
//! cadence, same errors at the same rows, zero lane-held cross-call state),
//! and the one-row batch is fully consumed within the producing driver
//! round (the IndexOnlyScan one-row-batch precedent), so nothing survives a
//! Volcano call boundary that the node's own C state does not.
//!
//! WHY a source form when delegation already exists (contract §6.Q):
//! source-form hosts (a) attribute as lane-DISPATCHED drives in the census
//! and (b) count as lane-owned CHILDREN — `t3_sort_child_admit` below lets
//! the sort breaker's memoized child verdict admit these shapes, which
//! transitively unlocks the pervasive `child-not-lane-owned` refusals in
//! every host that composes over the sort breaker (bare Sort,
//! Limit/Unique-over-sort, and the wave-4 Group / Result / SubqueryScan
//! streaming glue — all of them consume `sort_lane_fusible_memo`, so ONE
//! child-verdict extension unlocks the whole family; that IS the §6.Q
//! inc-final composition).
//!
//! **SubqueryScan stays delegation** (contract §6.Q: its win is pure
//! composition over now-lane-owned children, not a new source). ValuesScan
//! and the other wave-2 tail shapes stay delegation-only — out of the T3
//! candidate set, and keeping them off this path keeps the m4 insert/batch
//! instruction letters byte-identical (the VALUES arm never reads the T3
//! knob).
//!
//! Knobs (contract §2.1; registered in notes/se-phase0-integration.md):
//!   * `PGRUST_LANE_V2_SCANS_T3` — the facility gate. **Default resolves
//!     PER SHAPE through the wave-7 flip ledger since the B1 board** (flip
//!     manifest §2 B1; wave-7 contract §2 "per-shape revertable commits"):
//!     unset resolves through the Tier-B hatch
//!     (`PGRUST_LANE_V2_DEFAULTS=legacy` restores the pre-flip default OFF
//!     wholesale) to ON-BY-DEFAULT, and a shape is then default-armed iff
//!     its `T3Shape::flipped_default` ledger row is `true` — one flip
//!     commit per shape, one ledger line per commit, so any single shape
//!     reverts without disturbing the rest. The explicit `=1`/`on` and
//!     `=0`/`off` spellings are permanent and win over the hatch in both
//!     directions (flips never delete knobs); explicit `=1` arms ALL
//!     shapes exactly as it did pre-flip (the ledger only drives the
//!     default resolution). OFF-first LAW unchanged: the cached-bool check
//!     runs BEFORE any other work on every path into this module;
//!     facility-OFF ticks NOTHING, and a DEFAULT-UNFLIPPED shape under the
//!     default-armed facility is byte-and-census-SILENT too (it is
//!     pre-flip there — silence, not `env-off`).
//!   * `PGRUST_LANE_V2_SCANS_T3_<SHAPE>=0` — per-shape force-off spellings
//!     (`FUNCTIONSCAN`, `TABLEFUNCSCAN`, `SAMPLESCAN`, `TIDSCAN`,
//!     `TIDRANGESCAN`, `NAMEDTUPLESTORESCAN`); the wave-2 P1-analog RULE:
//!     these exist in code BEFORE any per-shape fleet A/B is run. A
//!     forced-off shape under an armed facility knob ticks `env-off` (the
//!     metaagg `=0`-disarm precedent) and falls through to the delegation
//!     form / Volcano unchanged.
//!
//! Delegation-form hosting under `PGRUST_LANE_V2_ROWMODE` is NOT re-gated
//! (contract §2.1): both knobs are independent; when both arm, the source
//! form takes priority (rowmode_tail.rs try_own_* order) and delegation is
//! the rollback semantics.
//!
//! Gate order (host template, contract §4.4): knob (OFF = `Ok(None)`, ticks
//! nothing) → per-shape arm (force-off ticks `env-off` through the
//! `#[cold]` tail) → `es_epq_active` → backward → instrumented (each
//! refusal through the `#[cold]` tail) → `tick_owned` ONCE at the verdict
//! chokepoint → the one-row-batch drive. EPQ law §4.2: `es_epq_active` is
//! the first dynamic refusal after the knob gates.
//!
//! Accounting: the six classes reuse their frozen wave-2 `ShapeClass` rows
//! (contract §1.2: ZERO new classes) and the existing epq/backward/
//! instrumented/env-off reasons (+ detail strings) — the WS-Q inc-0
//! decision is **NO `SourceShape` mint**; `N_REASONS` stays 36 and stats.rs
//! is untouched (the §1.2 carrier duty is vacuous). Knob-ON, a dynamically
//! refused offer may tick the same (class, reason) twice per pull — once
//! here, once in the delegation tail (two mechanisms, two offers; the
//! SubqueryScan glue+tail precedent, documented in lane-gates.allowlist).
//! Mechanism attribution is the lane trace detail string ("scans-t3: ..."),
//! never a second class.
