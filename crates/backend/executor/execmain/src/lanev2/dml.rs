//! DML lane hosting — wave-2 WS-N inc-1 shipped the seam delegation; wave-3
//! WS-T ships increments 2/2b and the inc-3a stretch on top of the SAME
//! seams (wave-3 contract §6.T; full design + ladder in
//! docs/design/lane-dml-epq.md):
//!
//! * **inc-2 (TupleOp decomposition)**: `MtChildSource` now produces BARE
//!   child rows; `DmlInsertOp: TupleOp` composes the mt_* seams under the
//!   shared `pull_step_rows` driver — `accept = mt_accept_row`, `resume =
//!   mt_row_prologue + the mt_pending/mt_resume deferred-MERGE arm`,
//!   `source_exhausted = mt_source_exhausted`. THE LAW (`mt_row_prologue`
//!   runs BEFORE the child pull, never inside an accept body) is placed
//!   structurally: the driver's resume hook is its only pre-pull
//!   chokepoint, so the op arms `loop_top_owed` at construction and after
//!   every accepted row, and the driver cannot reach `next_row` without
//!   running the loop-top seam composition first. The borrow blocker the
//!   design doc names (`exec_insert` uses `index_eval_cx`, which a
//!   source-held prologue piece would also need) is DISSOLVED rather than
//!   bridged: the prologue piece never leaves the op — `DmlInsertOp` holds
//!   `&mut ModifyTableState` whole (disjoint from the driver-held subplan
//!   field of `ModifyTablePlanState`), so no `MtRowCtx` turn-passing and no
//!   re-borrow token are needed (and no RefCell, no raw pointers — the
//!   FORBIDDEN list). Statement-stream identity with `mt_step` is argued
//!   arm by arm on the impl below.
//! * **inc-2 (lane-fed INSERT..SELECT)**: a SELECT side whose top is a
//!   shape the lane arm dispatch owns stops being Volcano-pulled through
//!   the `exec_proc_node` match and becomes a direct feed
//!   (`MtLaneFedSeqScanSource`) into `DmlInsertOp` — a pure feed-shape
//!   change (the per-row dispatch match is hoisted; the statements are the
//!   seq_scan_arm's own). Admission unchanged.
//! * **inc-2b (LockRows TupleOp)**: `LockRowsOp` re-expresses lock-then-
//!   emit as `accept` over bare child rows via the `nodelockrows::
//!   lr_accept_row` seam, consuming WS-L's PINNED epq_eval-closure shape
//!   (docs/design/rowmode-tail.md §4 — changing it is a reconciler
//!   amendment, wave-3 contract §4.2). `ShapeClass::LockRows = 36` is
//!   SHARED with WS-L's delegation host: this hook ticks at its OWN
//!   verdict chokepoint with mechanism attribution in the trace detail
//!   (`dml-tupleop`), and the procnode arm reaches it only after the
//!   rowmode-tail hook declined (WS-L's knob behavior is unchanged at both
//!   of its arms).
//! * **inc-3a (stretch)**: UPDATE/DELETE admission behind the NESTED
//!   `PGRUST_LANE_V2_DML_UD` knob — verdict-widening ONLY
//!   (`nodemodifytable::mt_lane_shape_refusal`, the renamed+widened probe);
//!   `mt_step`/`DmlInsertOp` already route every operation through
//!   `mt_accept_row`, so there is NO new machinery. TM_Updated rechecks
//!   inside the delegated `exec_update`/`exec_delete` go through the ONE
//!   `epq_eval` closure (§4.2). `RefuseReason::DmlShape = 35` unchanged;
//!   detail strings differentiate.
//!
//! Knobs: `PGRUST_LANE_V2_DML` (the inc-1..3 family knob, default OFF;
//! knob-OFF ticks NOTHING — §2.2) and `PGRUST_LANE_V2_DML_UD` (default OFF;
//! readable ONLY after the DML host knob has already passed — `_UD` alone
//! flips nothing). `PGRUST_LANE_V2_DML_BATCH` is inc-4's and is NOT read
//! here (out of wave-3 scope, contract §0.3).
//!
//! Gate order (contract §4.4, exactly the wave-2 template): knob (OFF =
//! `Ok(None)`, ticks nothing) → `es_epq_active` (EPQ LAW §4.2: an active
//! recheck refuses ALL dml ownership until inc-5) → backward →
//! instrumented → shape probe → `tick_owned` ONCE at the verdict
//! chokepoint → the host drive.

//
// Knob `PGRUST_LANE_V2_DML_OC` (wave-5 contract §3 registry row; default
// OFF, NEVER default during migration): the nested OC admission knob.
// Read ONLY from `try_own_modify_table`'s shape-gate line, after
// `dml_enabled()` has already passed (the `_UD` nested-knob law verbatim)
// — `_OC` alone flips nothing, and at default config this byte is never
// loaded at all (§0.6 OFF-first: the resolve is a one-shot #[cold]
// memoized read; the OFF arm adds zero branches to any hot path because
// the only reader sits behind the already-non-default DML host knob).
//
// ON semantics THIS wave (§8.3): admits ONLY the ladder-named ON CONFLICT
// host arms — INSERT .. ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING and DO UPDATE on the
// already-admitted structural set (single result rel, plain table, no
// triggers, no partition routing, trivial RETURNING). The widening is
// VERDICT-ONLY (the inc-3a `admit_ud` precedent): `mt_step` already
// routes every operation through `mt_accept_row` → `exec_insert`, whose
// four oc_* seams compose the whole speculative-insert ceremony
// identically on both engines — no new machinery, routing stays
// `RefuseReason::DmlShape` (vocab mint: ZERO). MERGE arms refuse even
// knob-ON (the probe's `merge` arm is unconditional; C-side trace pin
// outstanding). EPQ LAW unchanged: `es_epq_active` refuses ALL DML
// ownership BEFORE the shape gate, so OC arms refuse inside rechecks; a
// recheck INITIATED by an owned OC drive (exec_on_conflict_update's
// epq_eval use) goes through the ONE pinned closure `mt_accept_row`
// already carries.
//
// Isolation mapping (contract §8.4, declared here + notes/se-ws-w-dml-oc
// .md): WS-W battery = insert-conflict-do-nothing,
// insert-conflict-do-update{,-2,-3}, insert-conflict-specconflict,
// merge-match-recheck, merge-insert-update, merge-delete, merge-update,
// merge-join — refusal-invariant multi-arm legs this wave (byte-identical
// across knob arms where refusal holds; dualexec-proved where OC arms
// engage: scripts/dualexec/corpus-dml-oc.sql). partition-key-update-1..4
// asserted STAYING REFUSED (partition-routing is still DmlShape).
//
// Capacity-one-sink checkpoint (§8.5): NO wave-5 OC arm composes a
// breaker sink — the OC drive is the existing `DmlInsertOp` +
// `RootAdapter::new(None)` composition, and OC never sets
// `mt_merge_pending_not_matched`, so `resume`'s deferred-emit leg stays
// MERGE-only-unreachable. The debug_assert'd capacity-one assumption in
// `DmlInsertOp::resume` therefore stands UNRESTRUCTURED and
// still-outstanding (recorded in the worklog note; the restructure is
// owed before MERGE admission or any breaker-sink composition).
