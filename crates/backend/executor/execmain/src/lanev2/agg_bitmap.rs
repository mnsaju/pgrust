//! SE-AGGBITMAP — the lane batch feed for aggregation over BitmapHeapScan
//! (single-executor deletion-prep, fused arm #4 `AGG_BITMAP` re-host).
//!
//! Plain English: today, a query shaped `Agg over Bitmap Heap Scan` (with no
//! extra scan filter and no projection) is driven by a "fused arm" — a
//! special-case batched loop living in procnode.rs behind the default-ON
//! `PGRUST_FUSED_ARM_AGG_BITMAP` kill knob. The row-executor deletion plan
//! wants that arm physically removed, but the SE-DELETION-PREP audit
//! (notes/se-deletion-prep.md arm #4) found the only lane hook for this
//! shape is the morsel-runtime plain-root arm (`runtime_bitmap`, needs
//! explicit arming) — so at stock serial defaults the fused arm OWNS the
//! shape and deleting it would drop the whole family to the slow per-tuple
//! path. This module is the lane replacement: the SAME drive, hosted in the
//! lane layer, so the procnode arm becomes deletable once this feed is
//! lettered and flipped default-ON (the WS-F/WS-AE `indexsource` playbook,
//! arms #2/#3 — this is the designed "inc-4" of that module doc, built as
//! its own estate).
//!
//! # What the drive is (byte-identity by construction)
//!
//! Knob ON, admitted shapes run `::nodeagg::exec_agg_batched` — the exact
//! kernel the fused arm calls — over the exact node primitives the fused
//! arm's `BitmapScanBatchSource` wraps:
//!   * `bitmap_scan_next_pagebatch` — the bitmap iterator advances one page
//!     (exact page or lossy chunk) and stages its visible tuples,
//!   * `bitmap_scan_batch_fetch` — stores staged tuple `i` into the scan
//!     slot and, on recheck pages, runs the page recheck qual
//!     (`bitmapqualorig`) PER ROW — C's `BitmapHeapNext` semantics exactly.
//! Same rows, same order, same per-row recheck program, same transition
//! order, same hash-agg spill machinery (`lookup_hash_entry` spill-mode +
//! `hashagg_finish_initial_spills` + the canonical retrieve refill), same
//! output bytes. The only new code on the hot path is this chokepoint's
//! admission walk and accounting.
//!
//! # Exact-vs-lossy TID semantics (the charter's hard rule)
//!
//! The batch shape honors C's semantics BECAUSE the recheck decision stays
//! below this seam: `table_scan_bitmap_next_pagebatch` sets the node's
//! per-page `recheck` flag from the iterator entry (exact page => the TIDs
//! are trusted, no recheck; lossy chunk / candidate match => every fetched
//! row runs `bitmapqualorig`), and `bitmap_scan_batch_fetch` applies it per
//! row. `storeless_ok` is FALSE (the fused source's stated override): a
//! storeless count(*) advance would count rows the recheck must reject on
//! lossy pages — visibility and recheck both resolve at fetch time.
//!
//! # Serial + parallel-aware coverage (shared iterator state)
//!
//! The fused arm has no parallel gate: a `Partial Aggregate <- Parallel
//! Bitmap Heap Scan` worker fragment reaches the same dispatch arm inside
//! each worker and is fused-arm-driven today (the arm #2 AGG_INDEX audit
//! found the identical situation — an unpriced parallel surface a serial
//! lane feed would strand). This feed therefore covers it: the build/attach
//! ceremony is procnode's `bitmap_table_scan_setup_dispatch` VERBATIM
//! (serial builds; parallel, only the `BM_INITIAL` winner builds and
//! everyone else attaches the shared iterator), and page claims below the
//! seam come off the shared iterator state (`TbmSharedIterator`) page by
//! page — each claimed page is staged, fetched, and rechecked wholly inside
//! the claiming worker, so per-worker byte-identity holds by the same
//! argument as serial.
//!
//! # Refuse-set (every refusal falls through byte-identically)
//!
//! Named, in order, after the silent knob/agg gates:
//!   * `epq` / `backward` / `non-mvcc-snapshot` — the fused gate's estate
//!     legs (`agg_fusible_common`), re-stated per pull;
//!   * `subplan-param` — the page recheck qual (`bitmapqualorig`) carries a
//!     SubPlan or exec-param. The per-row recheck is a plain `exec_qual`
//!     program on ALL paths (per-tuple, fused, this feed), but this feed
//!     refuses the shape fail-closed rather than own a recheck program
//!     whose parameter environment it cannot prove — the standalone bitmap
//!     lane's posture (`bitmap_heap_scan_refuse_reason`), kept verbatim.
//!     NAMED RESIDUAL for the deletion re-trace: these stay arm-owned.
//!   * `shape-qual-proj` — a scan qual or projection under the Agg. The
//!     fused arm refuses these too (procnode gate), so nothing is stranded;
//!     the per-tuple path is the incumbent and stays it.
//! The agg-side gate (`agg_batch_drainable`: AGG_PLAIN/AGG_HASHED, no
//! grouping sets / merge / sorted-input transitions / subplan transitions)
//! ticks `AggBuild`/`AggNotDrainable` per offered pull — there is no hook
//! ahead of this one that ticks for the bitmap arm (unlike the index arms,
//! where the sorted-agg hook does), so the tick is this chokepoint's own.
//! NOT refused: parallel (covered above); instrumentation is structurally
//! unreachable (an EXPLAIN ANALYZE child is a `PlanStateNode::Instrumented`
//! wrapper, so procnode's concrete BitmapHeapScan agg-arm match — where
//! this hook lives — never sees it; the fused arm relies on the same fact).
//!
//! # Interplay with the runtime bitmap arm (`runtime_bitmap`)
//!
//! The morsel-runtime hook dispatches BEFORE this feed. If it engages, this
//! feed never runs. If it built the bitmap and then refused (geometry
//! floor / engage fallback), the node is left `initialized` with the classic
//! iterator attached and NOTHING consumed — this feed (like the fused arm
//! in that situation) skips its own setup and drains byte-identically.
//!
//! # Accounting (knob-OFF = today's accounting, contract §7)
//!
//! Knob OFF this module ticks NOTHING — the fused arm owns the shape
//! exactly as today, and any OFF-path tick would drift the default floors.
//! Knob ON: one OWNED tick under `ShapeClass::BitmapHeapScan` per
//! lane-owned feed event (retrieve-phase pulls of a filled hash agg run
//! zero feed ceremony and tick nothing); child refusals per offered pull
//! under `BitmapHeapScan`; the agg-side gate under `AggBuild`. R-VOCAB
//! untouched: no new ShapeClass, no new RefuseReason.
//!
//! # Knob
//!
//! `PGRUST_LANE_V2_AGG_BITMAP` (default OFF; R-KNOBS registry spelling),
//! layered UNDER the master `pgrust.lane_executor` gate (the procnode hook
//! sits inside `crate::lanev2::enabled()`). OFF cost at the dispatch site =
//! one cached-bool test. Env-var (not GUC) per the standing `pg_settings`
//! byte-identity discipline (lanev2 module doc). The flip to default-ON is
//! the SE drivers' call, gated on the A/B letters — never this lane's.
