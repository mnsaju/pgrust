//! World-B: the PARALLEL lane-v2 row-emit boundary (gather-elimination Phase 2
//! wiring into the lane executor).
//!
//! # World-A / World-B / the non-lane-ownable tail
//!
//! - **World-A (already shipped):** the *serial* lane executor row-emits the
//!   single-rel scan + qual + projection shape — the push island
//!   `Source → (qual/project) Operator → RootAdapter` that `try_own_seq_scan`
//!   drives one tuple per `exec_proc_node` (`push.rs`). One thread, no funnel.
//! - **World-B (this module):** the *parallel* version of exactly that
//!   lane-ownable shape. N runtime workers each run the SAME lane push island,
//!   but the terminal sink is [`RowEmitSink`] (this file) instead of
//!   `RootAdapter`: it appends the projected tuple into the worker's funnel
//!   ring ([`runtime::RowFunnel`]) rather than a capacity-one buffer. The
//!   leader drains the rings to the wire with [`drain_lane_funnel`], porting
//!   `nodegather.rs::gather_readnext` (round-robin, stick-until-block). This is
//!   the runtime's first NON-BREAKER (streaming) taskset — see the invariant
//!   analysis in `runtime/src/funnel.rs`.
//! - **The non-lane-ownable tail (explicitly OUT of scope, stays on classic
//!   Gather):** any row-returning shape the lane cannot vectorize — multi-rel
//!   joins emitting rows, SRFs / ProjectSet, volatile or non-parallel-safe
//!   target exprs, WHERE CURRENT OF / EPQ recheck, cursors, and anything the
//!   push path already refuses (`push.rs cursor_store_batch_fill` carve-outs).
//!   Hosting the *row* (Volcano) executor under the funnel — a transport-only
//!   win with no vectorization — is a SEPARATE later step, deliberately not
//!   built here.
//!
//! # Status: FLIPPED ON for the FloorGuard band (GL-FUNNEL-4;
//! `PGRUST_RUNTIME_ROW_FUNNEL=0` kills — [`row_funnel_enabled`]).
//!
//! The fleet A/B ladder (GL-FUNNEL-1..4) proved the band: qualed selective
//! passthrough beats the shipped serial default 6.3x geomean and classic
//! Gather 0.905–1.037 across 1gb/10gb x DOP 4–16 under fair buffer residency
//! (byte-identity + engagement evidence at every point). Everything outside
//! the band (`try_passthrough_funnel`'s fail-closed gates) refuses to the
//! serial loop byte-identically. Matrix row: gap:scan-passthrough.

// Kill-switch-gated integration seam: the producer sink + leader drain compile
// against the real `Sink`/slot APIs but have NO live call site yet (the
// scheduler wiring that publishes the row-emit taskset and runs the drain lands
// with the fleet A/B, per the plan's migration discipline). Allow dead_code so
// the seam can land reviewed and tested ahead of that flip.
