//! W0 — funnel-into-writer: the write-dest admission slice of the parallel
//! passthrough funnel (parallel-writes design §4 rung W0;
//! scratchpad/night/parallel-writes-design.md).
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! CTAS / SELECT INTO / matview datafill run their SELECT through the World-B
//! passthrough funnel (`runtime_passthrough.rs`): N launched workers each
//! drive the lane push island over claimed heap-block morsels and stream
//! MinimalTuple images through per-worker rings; the LEADER drain feeds the
//! statement's existing leader-only write DestReceiver
//! (`DestReceiver::IntoRel` / `DestReceiver::TransientRel`) instead of the
//! wire — `dest.receive_slot(slot)` IS `intorel_receive` /
//! `transientrel_receive` (single-tuple `table_tuple_insert` with the
//! startup-captured `output_cid`, `TABLE_INSERT_SKIP_FSM`, bistate). ZERO
//! receiver code changes: the funnel hook was already dest-generic; this
//! module only decides ADMISSION.
//!
//! # Correctness argument (why leader-only writes need no new write theory)
//!
//! Every byte that touches the target heap is written by the SESSION thread,
//! exactly as the serial statement writes it:
//! - xid: assigned by `DefineRelation`/`make_new_heap` in `dest.startup`
//!   (execmain.rs runs startup BEFORE `execute_plan`), so the leader's
//!   `heap_insert` xid fetch never calls `AssignTransactionId` inside the
//!   parallel bracket (xact.rs guards fire only on ASSIGNMENT);
//! - cid: `output_cid` captured once at `intorel_startup`/
//!   `transientrel_startup` on the session thread and threaded down as a
//!   parameter; no `GetCurrentCommandId(true)` inside the bracket;
//! - WAL / TOAST / FSM / extension locks / minimal-WAL pending syncs: the
//!   serial write path verbatim, session thread only. Workers are pure
//!   READERS of the (pre-existing, committed) source relation.
//!
//! The one genuinely new admission: the statement SELF-CREATES its target
//! before the SELECT runs, so the transaction always has PENDING UNCOMMITTED
//! -DDL INVALIDATIONS at hook time — the launched-gang bind path already
//! handles exactly this (`parallel::parallel_worker_body`: warm claim is
//! refused when `shared.leader_pending_invals`, the cold arm runs
//! `InvalidateSystemCaches`, and `note_caches_tainted` covers the
//! abort-poison window — the shipped matview-datafill / legacy-Gather
//! precedent). The hook therefore admits `pending_invalidations` for write
//! dests ONLY; every other dest keeps the conservative refusal.
//!
//! # Status: FLIPPED ON (GL-W0-2; `PGRUST_RUNTIME_CTAS_FUNNEL=0|off` kills).
//!
//! The GL-W0-2 composition ladder (W0 + W0.1 pure-drain + W1 multi-insert,
//! scratchpad/night/GL-W0-2-letter.md) measured the stack ALWAYS-WIN vs
//! serial in its engagement region — every shape 0.23–0.64 at 2M rows,
//! DOP {2,4,8}, ground-truth row counts verified — and the region is
//! STRICTLY ADDITIVE: this hook engages only on serial-SHAPED plans
//! (`!use_parallel_mode` at the execute_plan call site), so Gather-planned
//! CTAS is untouched and W0 displaces only the serial per-tuple loop.
//! Honest region note for the census confirm leg: at default costs the
//! planner Gathers large CTAS SELECTs, so default-ON yield lives where
//! Gather is priced out or unavailable; the dop>=4 funnel-vs-Gather gap is
//! the drain loop (W2a's charter), not this flip's concern.
//! The kill restores the serial loop byte-identically; it also rides the
//! funnel's own `PGRUST_RUNTIME_ROW_FUNNEL=0` master kill.
//!
//! Fail-closed carve-outs (inherited from the hook's gates, listed here as
//! the write-shape reading): CTAS WITH NO DATA never runs the executor;
//! EXPLAIN ANALYZE sets `es_instrument` (refused); CREATE TEMP TABLE AS
//! creates the temp namespace at startup, so the binder policy's
//! `temp_state` refusal stands down the funnel; REFRESH ... CONCURRENTLY
//! takes the SPI path (refused by the SPI/cursor budget gates); non-heap
//! AMs refuse at the granule-map probe; count-limited runs refuse (the
//! portal-suspend rule).
