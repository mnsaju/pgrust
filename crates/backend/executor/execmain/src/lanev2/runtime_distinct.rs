//! M2 DISTINCT SINK — parallel exact-DISTINCT / COUNT(DISTINCT) on the
//! morsel runtime (docs/design/m2-sinks.md §3 donor B re-homed;
//! docs/design/parallelism-redesign-2026-07.md §2.2/§5-M2).
//!
//! Shape: the SERIAL-plan grouped distinct pipeline `Agg(AGG_SORTED) ← Sort
//! ← SeqScan(pgrcolumnar)` (the sorted grouped exact-DISTINCT class — and, with the
//! distinct-bytes car, the near-unique text-group-key donor-B class), executed as
//! one SealedParallelSink on the runtime: ACCEPT (granule-morsel scan →
//! PREWHERE → per-worker `PdBuilder` partial: compact int group keys +
//! canonical-bytes text keys (content identity, arena spans),
//! (acc,count) vocab words, exact `DistinctSet`s) → SEAL (parallel
//! per-worker freeze into `PdHandedTable`s) → COMBINE (256 group-partition
//! bucket-claim merges — disjoint partitions, single writer per output
//! cell) → finalize (concatenate buckets, publish). The parked leader
//! adopts the merged result through the UNCHANGED serial emit tail
//! (`agg_hashgroup_adopt_merged` → hashgroup emit): groups in the plan
//! Sort's prefix order, byte-identical to the serial arm by the donor's
//! identity argument (exact representational set equality;
//! order-insensitive-exact transitions; count/sum reassociation
//! unobservable).
//!
//! vs the Gather-era donor (pardistinct): the registry/handoff, the leader's
//! own partial, the stray-row queue drain, and the `spent` flag are all
//! GONE (no tuple queues exist); the vocabulary refusal is DROPPED — the
//! vocab companion-agg shape rides the sink (the donor's refusal priced the
//! per-row vocab accept against the fused classic GatherMerge drives, a
//! comparison that no longer exists here).
//!
//! Budget law (m2-sinks.md R3/R5; M3.5 §4): each Local gets the derived
//! `worker_budget` (C-parity per participant; participants = launched
//! helpers ≤ dop, so the memory envelope is the plan-shaped one, never
//! nthreads-shaped). A worker CROSSING its budget SPILLS an epoch of its
//! set values to its FileSet spill file (grouped int-set shapes; the
//! docs/design/m3.5-spill.md §4 arm, `PGRUST_RUNTIME_DISTINCT_SPILL=0`
//! restores phase 1) and keeps accepting bounded; a combine partition
//! whose pre-count crosses the budget SPLITS its spilled records by
//! `mix64(value)` bytes and merges bounded slices in sequence (inc-3b,
//! `PGRUST_RUNTIME_DISTINCT_SPILL_DEPTH` caps the recursion). Shapes the
//! spill cannot carry exactly — and split refusals (depth cap, or a merged
//! bucket whose TRUE deduplicated size cannot fit) — fall back to the
//! phase-1 law: the arm aborts the RG and the leader RERUNS THE SERIAL
//! ARM: exact, nothing consumed, bounded memory at every arm.
//!
//! Engagement layering (all cheap; absent = today's serial path, byte- and
//! perf-identical): PGRUST_RUNTIME=1 (pool spawned) + SET
//! pgrust.runtime_distinct_pool = <dop> (falling back to
//! pgrust.runtime_scan_pool — the lane's booked instrument vocabulary) +
//! PGRUST_RUNTIME_DISTINCT != 0 (arm kill switch, decoupled from the scan
//! arm's at m2-integration); see guc_tables::runtime_pool for the reconciled
//! three-arm surface. The plan surface stays the serial plan; EXPLAIN
//! unchanged; instrumented runs refuse (EXPLAIN ANALYZE stays C-exact).
