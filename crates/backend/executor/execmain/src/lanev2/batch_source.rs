//! THE STORAGE SEAM of the runtime scan drive (single-executor migration
//! §0.1: open / granules / read / capabilities) — [`BatchGranuleSource`],
//! the granule-addressed batch source the drive positions and reads through.
//! One instance per WORKER per scan; heap and pgrcolumnar dispatch live
//! BELOW this seam (nodeseqscan → tableam), where they already lived.
//!
//! Naming (integration contract R-NAME, permanent): the storage seam is
//! `BatchGranuleSource`; `executils::BatchSource` is the operator→operator
//! pull seam (re-exported as `AggBatchSource`) and is never renamed.
//!
//! Phase 1 (WS-K) lands the staged-batch READ face on the trait
//! (`batch_soa` / `qual_sel` / `skip_sel` / `lane_sel` / `emit`) plus the
//! transitional `seq_scan_bridge` (the inc-1 columnar-only escape hatch,
//! deleted by WS-A inc-2), and the dedicated heap implementor
//! [`HeapBatchSource`] behind `PGRUST_LANE_V2_HEAPFEED` (default ON since
//! the SE15 coupling flip; explicit `=0`/`off` = the kill switch;
//! knob-OFF paths construct [`SeqScanSource`] and run today's bytes).
//! Columnar claim-time readahead stays BELOW `position()` (the AM's
//! `set_granule_range` claim-window advise) and passes through untouched;
//! HEAP readahead is the source's own policy inside `position()` — a
//! bounded advisory `bufmgr_seams::prefetch_buffer` walk over the claim
//! window's head (`PGRUST_LANE_V2_HEAPFEED_READAHEAD`, default 0 = none).
//!
//! # Batch ownership / pin-lifetime ABI (settled here, per the migration doc)
//!
//! - **R1 CLAIM-SCOPED BATCHES**: a staged batch is valid from
//!   `next_batch() > 0` until the next `next_batch`/`position`/`end_claim`
//!   on the SAME source instance; never retained past that. Today this is
//!   enforced by convention (drains are synchronous inside `run_morsel`);
//!   when the read face lands (inc-2), accessors borrowing `&self` between
//!   `&mut` calls make it borrow-checked.
//! - **R2 WORKER-PRIVATE**: batches never cross threads. Each worker builds
//!   its OWN executor + scan descriptor (`build_worker_exec`); the only
//!   cross-thread currency is (a) `Arc<GranuleMap>` (immutable geometry),
//!   (b) `Arc<Part>`/mmap + SegMap below the seam (immutable storage),
//!   (c) exported partials — deep copies under per-ordinal mutexes.
//! - **R3 HEAP PINS**: the staged heap batch IS one pinned page (`rs_cbuf`);
//!   SoA byref cells and emitted tuples alias the pinned image
//!   (`heap_batch_deform_soa`: "pinned by rs_cbuf for the whole batch").
//!   Pins release on batch advance (n == 0 → end of scan), on reposition
//!   (`heap_set_block_range`'s defensive release), and the scan SLOT's pin
//!   on the drain's end-of-claim `exec_clear_tuple`. LAW: at claim settle
//!   the worker holds zero pins from that claim.
//! - **R3v VARLENA PIN-HOLDING (Phase-1 WS-K ratification — THE pin-lifetime
//!   decision at this ABI boundary)**: the read face's staged heap cells
//!   (including every byref/varlena Datum in the SoA lanes) alias the pinned
//!   page image directly — the ABI is PIN-HOLDING, not copy-into-arena.
//!   Rationale: (a) this is exactly today's serial discipline
//!   (`heap_batch_deform_soa`: "pinned by rs_cbuf for the whole batch"), so
//!   an arena copy would be a NEW, parity-risking path plus a per-batch
//!   memcpy of every varlena cell; (b) R1 (claim-scoped) + R2
//!   (worker-private) + R6 (batches never move) make the pin's validity
//!   window equal the batch read window, and the read face's accessors
//!   borrow `&self` between the `&mut` calls (`next_batch`/`position`/
//!   `end_claim`), so retaining a cell past the batch is a COMPILE error;
//!   (c) consumers that retain values past the batch (agg transitions)
//!   already copy into their own aggcontext — PG's byref-transvalue
//!   discipline — and the emitted-slot path takes its own pin
//!   (`heap_batch_store_slot`). Nothing above this seam may stash a staged
//!   pointer; a consumer needing batch-outliving bytes copies AT the
//!   consumer, never here.
//! - **R4 COLUMNAR SCRATCH**: staged cells alias per-scan decode scratch
//!   (ColDecode datums/dict/arena) rebuilt at granule/RG grain — NOT the
//!   mmap. Validity therefore requires epoch-integral claims: enforced at
//!   DEFINITION (`GranuleMap` boundaries = `Part::granule_starts`) and
//!   re-checked at position (`set_granule_range`'s cross-RG error).
//!   Coalesced multi-epoch claims are legal ONLY for consumers that
//!   subdivide via `GranuleMap::segments` (the scan drive's `morsel_body`;
//!   sink drains feed claims straight to `set_granule_range` and must not
//!   coalesce).
//! - **R5 CARRY-OVER MEMOS**: worker-private reader memoization across
//!   claims (same-RG `rg_checked` carry + dict scratch reuse) is permitted
//!   only for pure per-RG predicates under the engagement snapshot.
//! - **R6 STEALING (the morsel-runtime-v2 stealing/NUMA law)**: by R1+R2 a
//!   stolen or re-split granule has no batch state — stealing/shedding is
//!   claim-level only (today's shed happens between morsels; a claim is
//!   executed whole by its claimer). A batch NEVER outlives its claim; if a
//!   scheduler ever wants mid-claim handoff, the unconsumed REMAINDER of
//!   the claim (a granule range) is what changes hands, never staged state.
//!   Sources wanting cross-worker decoded reuse must publish source-level
//!   immutable shared state (`Arc<Part>`-class), never staged batches.
//!   NUMA-affine claiming moves the CLAIM, never the batch.
