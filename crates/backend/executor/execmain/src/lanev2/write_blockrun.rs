//! W2a increment 2 — worker-direct heap writes over transaction-private
//! block runs (parallel-writes design §4 rung W2;
//! scratchpad/night/w2-worker-writes-design.md).
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Increment 1 (pop-K drain batching, `write_funnel.rs`) shaved the funnel's
//! per-row drain tax but left the wall: every heap byte still flows through
//! ONE writer thread (workers ring-emit `MinImage`s, the leader alone runs
//! `write_buffer_receive`). This increment removes the writer from the hot
//! path entirely for the shapes it can own: each funnel WORKER opens the
//! write target itself, claims private disjoint block runs from a shared
//! [`BlockRunAllocator`], and runs the W1 multi-insert fill over its runs —
//! the leader drains nothing (the rings stay empty) and only sums row
//! counts at the seal.
//!
//! # Correctness spine (the design's census, as wired here)
//!
//! - identity: launched gang workers restore the leader's pre-assigned xid /
//!   fixed cids / snapshot / combocid / lock group (`parallel_worker_body`);
//!   the write stamps `output_cid` captured at receiver startup and threaded
//!   through shared state — no worker ever calls `GetCurrentCommandId(true)`
//!   or assigns an xid (the xact guards make either an ERROR).
//! - storage: page supply is the block-run mode of
//!   `RelationGetBufferForTuple` (bistate.block_run) — no FSM, no shared
//!   targblock, extension under the allocator's mutex with
//!   `EB_SKIP_EXTENSION_LOCK` (the target is created by this transaction
//!   under AccessExclusiveLock, so nothing else can extend or scan it).
//!   Disjoint runs mean no two participants ever content-lock the same
//!   target page.
//! - WAL: workers hold leased PGPROCs with real proc numbers — per-thread
//!   insert slots, spinlocked position reservation; the xl_prev chain is
//!   maintained by the reservation itself (multi-backend parity). The
//!   leader's commit record is inserted only after every worker sealed
//!   (`DestroyParallelContext` joins the gang before the engage returns), so
//!   the commit-LSN flush covers every worker record. Under
//!   wal_level=minimal the same-xact-created target skips WAL on EVERY
//!   participant — the worker-side `relation_needs_wal` probe is made
//!   leader-identical by the relcache `rd_firstRelfilelocatorSubid` restore
//!   (C c6b92041 parity, relcache/build.rs), and `begin` asserts agreement,
//!   failing the statement closed rather than splitting the relfilenode
//!   between logged and unlogged pages.
//! - the tripwire stays live: heapam's real `is_parallel_worker` refusal is
//!   wired (release-reachable), and this sink's writes ride an RAII
//!   [`ParallelWriteGuard`] token scoped to exactly its own calls.
//! - crash: the allocator is memory-only; a crash mid-load leaves an orphan
//!   relfilenode exactly like serial CTAS (workers' records target a
//!   relation whose creating transaction never committed).
//!
//! # Admission (STRUCTURAL only — the postmortem's no-estimate-cliffs law)
//!
//! IntoRel / TransientRel dest, heap AM, NO toast table on the target
//! (worker-side toast-relation + toast-index writes are W3), W1 buffering
//! armed, plain SKIP_FSM options (a future FROZEN lane must re-derive the VM
//! story before riding runs). Anything else falls back to increment 1's
//! batched leader drain, byte-identically.
//!
//! Knob: `PGRUST_W2A_BLOCKRUN` (default OFF; =1|on arms — the W2A family
//! spelling). Measurement lever until the GL-W2A-2 ladder rules.
