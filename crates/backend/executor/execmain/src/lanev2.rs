//! Lane executor v2 — the operator→operator batched execution lane (production
//! rebuild). See `docs/design/lane-executor-v2.md`.
//!
//! Control model: **push** (Source → Operator → Sink), with a pull adapter at
//! the pipeline root because PostgreSQL's executor is Volcano/pull — the lane
//! is a push island that doles one tuple per `exec_proc_node` call out of the
//! root adapter's capacity-one buffer. The skeleton (traits + driver + root
//! adapter) lives in `lanev2/push.rs`; this file owns the per-scan refuse-sets
//! and the scan pipelines (source + scalar filter/project operator). The
//! conversion changes ONLY who calls whom: the batch staging primitives, the
//! one-row-at-a-time scalar emit, their order, and the refuse-sets are exactly
//! the Phase-1 pull drive's — byte-identical output.
//!
//! ALL substantive lane logic lives in this module, kept deliberately separate
//! from the byte-identical Volcano row-executor spine (`procnode.rs`,
//! `nodeseqscan`, `nodeagg`, …). The existing executor is touched in only a
//! handful of thin, mechanical spots:
//!   * `procnode::seq_scan_arm` — a 3-line dispatch hook (`if enabled() { if let
//!     Some(r) = try_own_seq_scan()? { return Ok(r) } }`) that falls through to
//!     the UNCHANGED per-tuple path on refuse;
//!   * `nodeseqscan::SeqScanState` — a two-`u32` page-batch cursor + accessors
//!     (the one-tuple-per-call drive needs its position to survive the Volcano
//!     call boundary, so this state must live on the node);
//!   * `executils::BatchSource` — the shared pull seam trait (it cannot live
//!     here: `nodeagg` re-exports it as `AggBatchSource`, and `nodeagg` cannot
//!     depend on `execmain` without a crate cycle, so the trait sits in the
//!     shared `executils` seam both crates already depend on).
//! Disabling or deleting the lane is therefore local: drop this module + the
//! thin hook, and the C-identical executor is exactly as before.
//!
//! Gated ON by default (as of 2026-07-14) via the `PGRUST_LANE_V2` env var;
//! `PGRUST_LANE_V2=0`/`off` is the explicit kill switch — the operational
//! escape hatch and the A/B lever. Env-var gating mirrors `jit_deform`'s
//! `PGRUST_JIT_DEFORM` switch and is byte-identity-safe (no `pg_settings` /
//! `SHOW ALL` row). Harness OFF arms must set `PGRUST_LANE_V2=0` explicitly.

// it PREEMPTS the row executor's own fused SoA-bitmap WithQual drive.
//
// Revisited with the Phase-3 qual kernel (2026-07-11): lane-owned filtered
// scans now carry the same selection bitmap, but for a STANDALONE scan the
// incumbent per-node drive is `exec_seq_scan_batch` — the identical bitmap
// over the identical staging, with NO pull-adapter round trip per surviving
// row on top. The lane can therefore only match-or-lose here (the narrow-sort-class
// adapter overhead stands), so the refuse stays. It shrinks when standalone

// Packed multi-key GROUP BY (multikey spike 2026-07-14 — the two-key
// int+text `GROUP BY` grouped-count shapes): a batch pre-pass packs the N
// fixed-width key components of a staged window into ONE synthetic u64/u128
// key lane (REUSED per-batch scratch — the spike's 5.5ms-vs-45.5ms verdict),
// then ALL single-key compact-table machinery runs unchanged through
// `KeyRepr::Int`/`Int128` + CRC32C. A dict-coded text component is made
// packable by the per-epoch code → scan-lifetime intern-id resolve
// (dictgroup's lazy resolve retargeted from pergroup pointers to stable u32
// ids, spike §2.3); the intern table's reverse map materializes the text at
// read-back/migrate. NULL components (heap) fold into a null-bitmap byte in
// the key image (CH `nullable_keys128`); pgrcolumnar rides the no-NULLs proof.
//
// Fallback discipline: multi-key has NO C staged-probe leg (the tuplehash
// kernel is Expr) — the compact table is the ONLY packed host. The runtime
// backstop check runs BEFORE each batch's per-row emit (qual evaluated
// exactly once per row either way); after a migration the feed falls to the
// per-row arrival probe for the batch and the rest of the scan, with every
// group already in the C table (compact_migrate reconstructs component
// datums and inserts through the unmodified `lookup`, C-exact hashes).

// a policy line, not an architecture gap". Knob-ON, the bare sort hook
// admits randomAccess sorts (scroll cursors, nestloop-inner REWIND,
// mergejoin mark/restore): `sort_lane_begin` already builds the tuplesort
// with TUPLESORT_RANDOMACCESS off the node flag, the lane serves ONLY
// forward pulls (`sort_lane_next` — the same cursor advance `exec_sort`'s
// forward drain performs), and every random-access read rides the row-path
// fallbacks over the SAME node state: backward pulls refuse at
// `try_own_sort`'s direction gate and fall to `exec_sort`'s
// direction-aware drain; rewind rides `exec_rescan_sort`'s
// tuplesort_rescan arm; mark/restore ride `exec_sort_mark_pos`/
// `exec_sort_restr_pos` on the tuplesort directly.
//
// Scope fences (each recorded in notes/se-wave8-sortfeed.md):
//   * CHAIN hosts keep refusing randomAccess — the shared
//     `sort_refuse_reason` policy line is unchanged, so every chain memo
//     verdict is byte-identical to wave-7's. (A refused chain still lands
//     on the bare hook underneath when Volcano pulls the Sort node, so the
//     feed win materializes for chain shapes too.)
//   * The RA-VANILLA FEED LAW: an admitted randomAccess feed is
//     `exec_sort`'s construction verbatim — no runtime-sink adoption
//     (self-refused, runtime_sort.rs randomAccess gate), no zone-adaptive
//     order, no top-k cut, no refsort, no narrowed comparator, no agg
//     top-N specs (`sort_feed_if_needed` gates below). Every one of those
//     arms either replaces the tuplesort read-back face or reorders/
//     prunes arrival — sound for forward LIMIT reads, unproven for
//     random-access replay. The batched drains stay (put-order-identical
//     hoists into the real tuplesort).
//   * EXPLAIN (ENGINE) capture keeps reporting the chain-scope verdict
//     (RandomAccess) for these nodes knob-ON — ledgered inc-1 limitation;
//     production ownership shows in the SortFeed owned ticks.

// ===========================================================================
// Streaming top-k cutoff on the sort-breaker feed (pgrcolumnar-v2 plan §2.8;
// ClickHouse PartialSortingTransform's threshold filter, our shape). For a
// bounded (top-N) sort, once the tuplesort's bounded heap is FULL every
// further put is compare-against-the-k-th-boundary-and-usually-discard. The
// pre-filter hoists that discard in front of the breaker: each staged batch
// is compared VECTORIZED (the existing `qual_bitmap_cmp_const` kernel, with
// the tuplesort's live k-th boundary datum as the "const") against the
// staged leading-key lane, and rows that cannot make the top k are skipped
// without an emit or a tuplesort put.
//
// CORRECTNESS INVARIANT (the proof the admission rules exist to keep): the
// pre-filter may skip EXACTLY rows the tuplesort itself would discard with
// no observable side effect. Piecewise:
//   * A bounded tuplesort in TSS_BOUNDED discards an incoming tuple iff
//     full_cmp(tuple, root) >= 0, where `root` (the bounded heap's top under
//     the reversed comparator) is the current WORST surviving member and
//     `full_cmp` is the full multi-key comparator (tuplesort.rs
//     `puttuple_bounded`).
//   * The pre-filter discards row R iff R's LEADING key is STRICTLY worse
//     than the boundary's leading key: `keep = R.k1 <op-order> boundary.k1
//     OR ties` — implemented as the non-strict keep compare (ASC keeps
//     `k1 <= b`, DESC keeps `k1 >= b`). Strictly-worse on the leading key
//     forces full_cmp(R, root) > 0 regardless of later keys — the multi-key
//     comparator is lexicographic — so every skipped row is a row tuplesort
//     would discard. Leading-key TIES ALWAYS PASS (they can still win on
//     later keys); equal-or-better rows always pass. Datum-sort ties also
//     pass and the tuplesort re-judges them — a pure subset, never a
//     different verdict.
//   * NULL leading keys are never pre-filtered (the keep mask ORs the
//     lane's null bits): a NULL's rank depends on NULLS FIRST/LAST, and the
//     tuplesort's own comparator is the authority. A NULL boundary disables
//     the batch's pre-filter entirely (nothing compares strictly-worse
//     against NULL through the kernel; conservative pass-through).
//   * Deform-fallback rows (no staged lane value) always pass.
//   * The boundary only TIGHTENS as puts replace the root (the reversed
//     heap's top is monotonically non-worsening in forward order), so the
//     once-per-batch boundary snapshot is stale-but-conservative: it only
//     lets through rows the tuplesort then judges itself.
//   * Skipping a row skips its emit body, so admission requires the emit to
//     be observation-free per row: NO scan qual (a qual evaluation C would
//     have run — including its possible error — must not be elided) and
//     only pure-Var projections (the single Var-copy kernel or the all-Var
//     census list — never a computing column). Under that shape a
//     skipped row's only C-side effects were the tuplesort compare+discard
//     (and its per-row CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS; the filtered path keeps one
//     CFI per staged batch, the lane's page-level cadence floor).
//   * By-value leading keys only (the CmpOp kernel families): the boundary
//     datum read from the heap root must not dangle when a later put in the
//     same batch evicts the root's tuple.
// Net: the same rows reach the tuplesort as would have survived its own
// bounded discards, in the same order, and the sorted output is
// byte-identical. This is a pure skip optimization with zero refusal
// surface — non-admission simply feeds the sort unfiltered, exactly as
// before.

// Zone-ordered adaptive top-N traversal (pgrcolumnar; pgrcolumnar-v2 plan, design in
// docs/design/pgrcolumnar-zone-adaptive.md). For `ORDER BY x LIMIT k` over a
// pgrcolumnar scan, the granule directory's footer min/max gives a partial order
// on x: visiting granules best-first (zone min ascending for ASC / max
// descending for DESC) and feeding the bounded sort's k-th boundary back to
// the scan lets the scan STOP at the first granule whose bound the boundary
// strictly dominates — every remaining granule is at least as dominated
// (ClickHouse-style read-in-order early termination, but zone-map-driven, so
// it works on non-cluster-key columns).
//
// CORRECTNESS: a bound-skipped granule contains only rows STRICTLY worse
// than the current boundary on the LEADING key — rows the bounded tuplesort
// would discard with no observable side effect (topkcut's invariant, granule-
// granular; equality never skips, `strict=false` at the AM). Observation-
// freedom of the elided per-row work is the arm's admission: pure-Var
// projections (the shared resolution) and no qual / whole-qual staged
// kernels (non-erroring vocabularies; `seq_scan_adaptive_topk_arm`).
//
// TIE EXACTNESS is the residual risk: the adaptive order changes ARRIVAL
// order at the bounded heap, and both the survivor selection at a boundary
// full-key tie and the emit order among retained full-key ties are arrival-
// dependent (heap-shape effects). Shape/mode ladder:
//   * ties-invisible (every non-junk output column IS a sort key column of
//     a byte-equality type): any legal tie selection/order prints identical
//     bytes — nothing to track.
//   * payload-visible, relaxed (DEFAULT; ratified tie-ordering rule 3): the
//     tuplesort's tie tracking (armed via `sort_lane_topk_tie_track_arm`)
//     still runs, and a CUT-SELECTION trigger (which rows made the LIMIT
//     cut is arrival-dependent) DEMOTES — fresh tuplesort, adaptive
//     disarmed, full physical-order re-feed — so the SELECTED SET is always
//     the physical-order feed's. A RETAINED-ORDER trigger (same rows,
//     arrival-dependent order within equal-full-key groups) is accepted:
//     within-tie-group order is not a compatibility surface.
//   * payload-visible, `=tracked`: EITHER trigger demotes — byte-identical
//     to lane-off, the experiment/A-B channel.
// Net: lane-on output is byte-identical to lane-off except, in relaxed
// mode, for the order within equal-full-key tie groups of the emitted rows
// (tie-normalizing gates cover that channel).

// ===========================================================================
// Emit-side top-N boundary cut on the hash-agg-fed sort breaker (lane-v2
// topnemit; the emit-side complement of the scan-level topk_cut above). The
// `GROUP BY keys ORDER BY count-agg DESC LIMIT k` tail (the grouped-count
// top-n family class) today EMITS EVERY GROUP — key reconstruction, finalize,
// projection, minimal-tuple form, sort put — into a bounded sort that keeps
// k. Once the bounded heap is full, each further put is compare-against-the-
// k-th-boundary-and-usually-discard; this arm hoists that compare all the
// way into the agg retrieve, in front of the WHOLE per-group emit body.
//
// CORRECTNESS INVARIANT (same family as topk_cut's, tie-relaxation-free):
//   * The retrieve skips group G iff G's leading-key value is STRICTLY worse
//     than the bounded heap root's leading key (heap FULL — `topk_boundary`
//     returns None otherwise, disabling the cut). A strictly-worse leading
//     key forces full_cmp(G, root) > 0 (lexicographic), so the tuplesort
//     would discard G with NO state change (`puttuple_bounded`'s compare<=0
//     arm frees the tuple and returns). Removing exactly no-state-change
//     puts leaves every heap transition, every tie selection, and the
//     surviving arrival ORDER identical — the sorted output is
//     byte-identical BY CONSTRUCTION, with no reliance on the ratified
//     tie-order relaxation. Leading-key ties and better keys always pass;
//     NULL/pending transvalues always pass (rank depends on NULLS placement;
//     the tuplesort's comparator stays the authority).
//   * The compared value is the group's RAW int8 transvalue; admission
//     (`topn_emit_resolve`) proves it IS the finalized, projected sort-key
//     datum: finalfn-none int8-byval aggregate (count(*)/count(x)/sum-int
//     family) projected as a bare tlist Aggref. The boundary datum is the
//     same column's datum1 in the heap root — an i64/i64 compare in the
//     leading order operator's own direction (Int8Lt/Int8Gt kernel families
//     only), matching btint8cmp exactly.
//   * Skipping a group elides its whole emit body, so admission requires it
//     observation-free: no HAVING qual, every other tlist entry a bare
//     Var/Const/Aggref, and every skipped finalfn in the pure-arithmetic
//     allowlist (`TOPN_SKIPPABLE_FINALFNS`) — nothing C could observably do
//     (no reachable error, no side effect) is elided. Skipped groups keep a
//     per-group CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS (the elided sort put's cadence).
//   * The boundary only TIGHTENS as puts replace the root, and it is
//     re-read from the live heap before every retrieve call; within one
//     call's skip run no puts happen, so the held boundary is
//     stale-but-conservative — it only lets through groups the tuplesort
//     then judges itself.
// Net: a pure skip optimization with zero refusal surface — non-admission
// feeds the sort through the unfiltered breaker path, exactly as before.

// Lane-v2 topkfin (hot-c1-topk-finalize): top-k group selection BEFORE

// EVERY group the topnemit boundary cut can't skip — and the streaming cut
// only skips groups STRICTLY worse than the live k-th boundary, so on flat
// order-key distributions (two-int-key high-card: ~10M groups, boundary count ~1) it skips
// nothing and ~10M numeric-avg divisions + tuple forms feed a sort that
// keeps 10. This pass selects the k surviving groups FIRST, on the raw int8
// order-key states (`nodeagg::topk_finalize_select` — a bounded (key, row)
// heap in first-arrival total order), then runs the batched finalize+emit
// for those k rows only.
//
// Admission (fail-closed, on top of the batchemit + topnemit admissions the
// caller already proved):
//   * single-column ORDER BY (the k-th boundary's tie-break must not need
//     secondary keys);
//   * bounded sort with a sane positive bound;
//   * relaxed adaptive-topk tie mode (the selected members of the boundary
//     tie group are the first-arrived, deterministic, C-LEGAL set — rule 2
//     of docs/conformance/tie-ordering.md applied to agg groups; `tracked`
//     and `0` stay byte-exact channels and never arm this);
//   * every group's order-key transvalue non-NULL, checked row-by-row inside
//     the selection scan (a NULL bails the whole pass before any side
//     effect — NULLS placement stays the tuplesort's authority).
// Kill switch: PGRUST_LANE_V2_TOPKFIN=0. Declines are never lane refusals —

// ===========================================================================
// Refsort — late-materialization top-N on the pgrcolumnar-fed bounded sort
// breaker (notes/latemat-lane.md, Phase B conversion 1). For `... WHERE
// <qual> ORDER BY key LIMIT n` over a lane-armed pgrcolumnar scan with a
// Var-only child tlist, the legacy feed projects EVERY survivor to a full
// slot and puts a full minimal tuple into the bounded tuplesort — of which
// only <= n winners ever emerge. The refsort feed instead puts NARROW
// (key, ref) rows (ref = the survivor's pgrcolumnar (rg, row) address) into a
// synthetic 2-col tuplesort built with the plan's leading-key comparator,
// then AFTER performsort gathers only the <= bound winners' full rows via
// `gather_row` and buffers the projected outer tuples on the node
// (`refsort_out`), which the emit face serves in sorted order.
//
// CORRECTNESS (the design note's invariants):
//   * Winner selection/order: same comparator (plan key-0 operator/
//     collation/nullsFirst over the same key datums), same put order
//     (ascending staged rows, survivors only), same ALLOWBOUNDED discard
//     and tie retention => the winner SET and their output ORDER are
//     byte-identical to the legacy feed's, by construction.
//   * Key currency: clean exact-bitmap rows read the key from the staged
//     SoA column — the same cells the legacy emit's projection copies.
//     Requal/fallback rows (and batches without an exact bitmap or a ready
//     key lane) run `seq_scan_batch_emit` per row — the exact per-row qual
//     (C detoast semantics, C's errors on C's row) — and read the key from
//     the projected slot cell. Same rows survive, same order.
//   * Deferred projection is Var-only by admission (physical tlist or the
//     all-Var census): a Var copy cannot err, so eliding per-survivor
//     projection and materializing only winners elides nothing C could
//     observe. gather_row re-decodes from the pinned Part under the CURRENT
//     needed set (tlist Vars are in the scan's needed set by construction;
//     the gather-time null guard demotes if not — before any output).
//   * Demote discipline: any batch without a window ref, and any gather
//     failure, demotes to the legacy feed BEFORE any output escapes (the
//     winners buffer is node-internal until the emit face pops it):
//     fresh tuplesort + child rescan + physical re-feed, the adaptive-topk
//     demote pattern. Demotion is sticky per node.
//   * Views/refs never cross a rescan: every rescan/reset path clears the
//     narrow tuplesort, the marker, and the winner buffer.
// Composes with topk_cut (the keep mask filters the same rows the bounded
// heap would discard — shared `TopkCutState::batch_mask`) and with the
// zone-adaptive traversal (refs are rg-global, order-independent; the tie
// demote machinery runs on the narrow sort's identical leading-key ties).
// Kill switch: PGRUST_LANE_REFSORT=0|off. Never a lane refusal —
// non-admission runs the legacy feed unchanged.

// Sorted-agg (AGG_SORTED) streaming operator (Phase-2 breadth). NOT a
// breaker: input arrives sorted on the grouping keys, so the node emits a
// finalized group at each key boundary and never needs the whole input — it
// sits as a mid-pipeline `TupleOp` between a lane-owned ordered feed and the
// root pull-adapter:
//
//   Agg over Sort (two chained pipelines on the sort breaker):
//     pipeline N   : scan source → filter/project → SortBreakerSink
//     pipeline N+1 : SortEmitSourceCfi → SortEmit → SortedAggOp → RootAdapter
//   Agg over IndexScan / IndexOnlyScan (order from the index, one pipeline):
//     IndexScanSource → IndexScanEmit → SortedAggOp → RootAdapter
//
// The lane owns ONLY control flow; ALL semantics delegate to the row-path
// nodeagg seam (`agg_sorted_*`): the group-boundary comparison is the ported
// grouping-equality ExprState (NULL keys group together through it), the
// per-row transition program, and the finalize/HAVING/project tail are
// `agg_retrieve_sorted`'s own pieces over the node's own persort state
// (first/pending slots + `have_pending`). Because the seam maintains exactly
// the pull loop's node state — every call boundary has the current group
// closed and at most a pending boundary tuple saved — a per-call fallback to
// `exec_agg` (dynamic gates) is byte-safe in both directions.
//
// Per-tuple laziness holds: the capacity-one root buffers the boundary
// group's row, pausing the pipeline (the child feed advances only to the
// boundary tuple, which is saved in the pending slot before the pause).
// End-of-stream uses the driver's `TupleOp::source_exhausted` hook (the
// Finished-vs-more-phases seam) to finalize the last
// open group; `agg_done` (set exactly where the pull loop sets it) makes the
// drained node stay drained.
//
// v1 is deliberately per-row (correctness first): the ordered feeds emit
// one-row batches (sort read-back) or short TID runs, so there is no clean
// whole-batch group-run fold seam here yet; the lanefold `fold_rows_grouped`
// batching over contiguous group runs is a later, measured step.

// (`agg_hashgroup_economical`). Anything else falls to the narrow-sort arm
// unchanged. At runtime, crossing the arm's memory budget mid-build
// DEGRADES to the narrow-sort arm exactly once: the narrowed tuplesort is
// begun late, the deferred group representatives + all remaining rows feed
// it, and the narrow emit chain resumes with per-group residual-state
// preload (nodeagg's `initialize_aggregates` hook) — so the arm is
// spill-safe wherever the narrow-sort arm is.
//
// Fallback safety: once the build consumed the scan, the plan's Sort node
// must never be fed again (it would rebuild empty from the exhausted scan).
// The no-degrade emit therefore resumes BEFORE the per-call dynamic gates —
// sound because the emit touches no scan, backward fetches imply
// randomAccess (refused at admission, so the executor never runs this node
// backward), and es_epq_active is constant for the estate this node was
// built in (EPQ rechecks run their own estate). The degraded path needs no
// such care: the sort IS built there, so the existing per-call narrow-arm
// resume (and even the per-tuple C fallback) is byte-safe.

// per surviving row one direct-map index + one chain append of the DISTINCT
// arg — and resolve code→string once per distinct (epoch, code); the emit
// k-way-merges the per-epoch byte-sorted runs (sorted dicts) into the plan
// Sort's ASC memcmp-tier group order, unioning equal-content states' chains
// into the pertrans exact set through the unchanged finalize tail.
//
// Interned-int-key negative-precedent boundary (dictgroupwire, feded70a7): for a K2 FOLD
// under a selective qual, per-(epoch, code) lazy STRING RESOLVES INTO THE
// HASH TABLE lost to hashing survivor strings directly (survivors-per-epoch
// ≈ codes-per-epoch). This arm's alternative is NOT a hash probe — it is the
// narrowed SORT — and its per-code cost is one image memcpy (no hash, no
// table), with the cross-epoch identity resolved once at emit by the merge
// instead of per (epoch, code) at build. The gepoch upgrade (globaldict
// stitch tables, train-9 format group) deletes even the merge's string
// compares: part-stable byte-rank codes make the merge an integer compare
// and equal-gcode states merge with no memcmp at all — the documented
// increment-2 consumer.
//
// Admission tier: engages ONLY where the hash arm's density tier refuses
// (the two arms partition the density axis at MIN_ROWS_PER_GROUP), pgrcolumnar
// scans only, dict-answered sorted windows only, bare-Var projections, the
// near-unique-key transition shape (one set-mode COUNT(DISTINCT <bare int Var>)).
// Everything else falls through to the hash arm / narrow sort exactly as
// before. Runtime degrade replays every absorbed (key, arg) row into the
// narrowed sort — no residual state, the narrow emit chain runs unchanged.

// SeqScan` with NO Sort node (the pathkeys come from the store order), so
// neither the hashed fold breaker (AGG_HASHED only) nor the sorted-agg-over-
// Sort arm can host it. Two drives, chosen once per node:
//
//   * Fold (`sorted_fold_step`): per staged column window, detect the group
//     boundaries over the staged SoA key lanes (width-masked raw-datum
//     compare — exactly the ported grouping-equality program's verdict under
//     the node's representational-equality grant, NULL keys grouping
//     together via the null-pair compare), then run the admitted PLAIN
//     transitions as ONE `lanefold::fold_batch` per group run — the hashed
//     feed's kernels (strlenfold's charlen included), fed per group run
//     instead of per table. Group prologue (first row), boundary emit
//     (finalize + HAVING + project), residual transitions and fallback rows
//     all delegate per row to the same `agg_sorted_*` seams the per-row
//     operator uses.
//   * PerRow (`sorted_perrow_step`): the SortedAggOp chain over the scan's
//     staged batches (SeqScanSource → SeqScanFilterProject → SortedAggOp).
//     The pgrcolumnar incumbent is the per-pull Volcano drive, so the staged
//     window decode alone wins (the noqualfeed economics); hosts every
//     `agg_sorted_lane_admissible` shape incl. exact-DISTINCT set entries.
//
// pgrcolumnar scans only: the planner produces this shape from pgrcolumnar footer
// pathkeys; heap SeqScans are never ordered, and heap's incumbent drives own
// heap agg shapes anyway (admission economics §4).
//
// Byte-identity: same rows through the same qual in the same order (the
// staged bitmap IS the kernel/PREWHERE verdict; per-row emits re-check
// exactly as the per-row drive; requal/resid shapes take the per-row-emit
// fold mode); group boundaries are the grouping-equality verdicts
// (representational grant); every fold kernel is bit-for-bit equal to C's
// transition semantics on admitted/guard-proven data (lanefold contract) and
// guarded batches that fail re-proof demote WHOLESALE to the checked per-row
// program; finalize/HAVING/project is `agg_sorted_emit` per group in input
// order — group emit order = input order = C's order. Cross-call state is
// node-resident (scan lane cursor + persort pending slot): every mid-stream

// Hash-join pipeline breaker (Phase 2). The join spans two pipelines plus a
// mid-pipeline streaming stage:
//
//   pipeline N   (build): inner scan source → scalar filter/project →
//                         HashJoinBuildSink   (breaker Sink face)
//   pipeline N+1 (probe): outer scan source → scalar filter/project →
//                         JoinProbe (TupleOp) → sink
//
// The build side is the breaker: `accept` = the row-path per-row hash +
// `ExecHashTableInsert` (`nodehash::lane_build_accept` — spill/growth arms
// included), `finish` = the delegated build tail (`finish_build`,
// empty-build early return, `nbatch_outstart`/`dense_on`, phase flip). The
// probe side is NOT a breaker — it streams: one outer row in, 0..K joined
// rows out, with the intra-row expansion position node-resident on the
// HashJoinState (`hj_CurTuple`/`hj_CurDense` — C's own cross-call state), so
// a mid-expansion pause resumes exactly. The phase flag is `hj_JoinState`
// itself (HJ_BUILD_HASHTABLE → HJ_NEED_NEW_OUTER — C's own state machine).
//
// Spill (§8): the build delegates wholesale to the row-path table, so nbatch
// growth happens exactly as the row path's; the lane then checks the FINAL
// nbatch after the completed build and REFUSES the probe when nbatch > 1 —
// before any lane tuple is emitted, so the fallback `exec_hash_join` resumes
// from HJ_NEED_NEW_OUTER over the identical table (postponing outer tuples
// to batch files exactly as if the row path had built it). Refusing on the
// planner's initial estimate alone would be insufficient: the row path grows
// nbatch mid-build (`ExecHashIncreaseNumBatches`), so only the post-build
// value is authoritative — and checking after a fully delegated build is
// byte-safe precisely because the build is bit-equal to the row path's.
//
// Admitted join types: all eight — INNER, LEFT, SEMI, ANTI plus the
// right-fill family RIGHT, FULL, RIGHT_SEMI, RIGHT_ANTI — with
// joinqual/otherqual residuals evaluated scalar-within-lane through the
// row path's exact `eval_probe_qual` (LEFT/FULL/ANTI null-fill emits happen
// inside `lane_probe_next`'s HJ_FILL_OUTER_TUPLE arm, exactly where C emits
// them). The right-fill types (`hj_fill_inner` — RIGHT/FULL/RIGHT_ANTI) add
// a post-exhaustion phase: when the outer source ends, the probe TupleOp
// becomes a SOURCE of never-matched build tuples (C's HJ_FILL_INNER_TUPLES
// via the driver's `source_exhausted` seam; the walk delegates to the
// row path's exact `ExecScanHashTableForUnmatched` port, so the fill
// emission order is C's bucket order for free; the cursor is C's own
// node-resident `hj_CurBucketNo`/`hj_CurTuple`, so a LIMIT pause mid-fill
// resumes exactly). RIGHT_SEMI needs no fill phase — only the has-match
// skip in the probe arm. Refused join shapes (assert-refuse set):
// multi-batch (above), parallel hash, instrumented, subplan/param-bearing
// hash, residual-qual or projection exprs, non-lane-fusible scan children
// on either side.

// NestLoop hosting (the deferred §4 bundle). The join is a mid-pipeline
// streaming `TupleOp` — NOT a breaker: one outer row in, 0..K joined rows
// out.
//
//   pipeline: outer scan source → scalar filter/project → NestLoopProbe
//             (TupleOp) → sink (RootAdapter, or the hash-agg breaker)
//
// Per accepted outer row the op runs C's need-new-outer arm
// (`nodenestloop::lane_accept_outer`): bind the outer tuple, assign the
// join's exec params (nestParams → PARAM_EXEC slots), and RESCAN the inner
// child; the expansion then streams each inner row through the joinqual /
// otherqual / projection (`lane_probe_next` = `exec_nest_loop`'s own loop
// body, LEFT/SEMI/ANTI arms included). The INNER child stays a Volcano
// child, driven per-row through the same `NestLoopChild` calls the row path
// uses (scalar-within-lane, per the design's allowance) — so exec-param-
// driven runtime keys on an inner index scan are evaluated in
// `exec_rescan_index_scan`'s preamble exactly as C's ExecReScan path does,
// AUTOMATICALLY. The Phase-1 lane scan gates therefore KEEP refusing runtime
// keys (`iss_Runtime`/`ioss_Runtime`) for LANE-OWNED scans: that relaxation
// belongs to the inner-as-lane-pipeline follow-up, where the lane would have
// to drive the rescan preamble itself. Expansion position across the Volcano
// pull boundary is the node's own `nl_NeedNewOuter`/`nl_MatchedOuter` — C's
// cross-call state; no new fields.
//
// Admission economics (design §4): NestLoop per-tuple in Volcano is already
// cheap; the lane's value is OWNERSHIP CONTINUITY — the outer side stays a
// lane pipeline feeding breakers above. The hooks engage (a) under the
// hash-agg breaker (`try_own_agg_over_nest_loop` — a lane consumer above,
// no fused competitor exists for this shape) and (b) bare
// (`try_own_nest_loop`) where the outer is a lane-fusible scan the join
// pipeline then owns — the bare hash-join precedent; there is no legacy
// fused NestLoop drive to preempt. Refused (assert-refuse set):
// instrumented, subplan/param-bearing joinqual/otherqual/projection,
// row-path-touched nodes (verdict stability), non-lane-fusible outer
// children, EPQ, non-forward. The inner child is unconstrained — it runs
// the identical Volcano calls at the identical points either way.

// feed). The join probe streams one joined row at a time — there is no page
// batch and no SoA deform on the agg's outer side — so the composition's agg
// breaker previously fed per-row (`HashAggBuildSink`), leaving the lanefold
// kernels disengaged. This sink stages joined rows into `LaneCols`-compatible
// arrays and folds the admitted transitions per staged batch (~the page-batch
// row cap) via the shared fold tail (`agg_fold_staged`), in two modes:
//
// * UNGUARDED plans (no data-level Guard — the common case): the group probe
//   + residual transitions run per row AT ARRIVAL against the incoming joined
//   slot (exactly the per-row sink's own call), snapshotting the pergroup;
//   only the fold lanes (`plan.cols` — always byval int-family by classify
//   construction) are staged, and the flush is just the whole-batch fold.
//   No replay slot, no datum copies: strictly the per-row sink minus the
//   admitted transitions' interpreted per-row steps. This mirrors the seqscan
//   fold feed's probe-then-fold split (residuals per-row inside the batch,
//   commutative fold after) — bit-identical by the lanefold contract.
//
// * GUARDED plans (int2/int4 OpExpr admissions carrying a Guard interval):
//   the guard must be re-proven BEFORE any probe/transition runs, and a
//   Demote must run the WHOLE batch through the checked per-row program — so
//   nothing may run at arrival. The sink stages every build-relevant column
//   (fold lanes + group keys + residual inputs — exactly the `colnos_needed`
//   set the hashagg spill projection keeps), and per batch: `check_guards`
//   (data-scan tier — join output has no zone map), Demote → replay every
//   staged row through `agg_hash_build_accept` (raises C's error at C's
//   row), else replay → probe/residual per row → fold. The replay slot
//   presents the same needed-column values in the same row order the per-row
//   sink would (unneeded columns NULL — the spill projection's own
//   treatment), so probe sequence, spill decisions, residual transitions,
//   and error rows are identical.
//
// Memory: the lanes are fixed-capacity (STAGE_ROWS), reused across batches;
// by-ref staged values on the guarded path (e.g. text group keys — they may
// point into per-tuple memory the probe resets row to row) are datum-copied
// into a dedicated bump context that is reset after every staged batch —
// per-batch, fixed-size, no unbounded growth.

// ===========================================================================
// Streaming Limit + Unique (Phase-2 breadth): mid-pipeline `TupleOp`s at the
// TOP of an already-lane-owned chain, engaged ONLY where the lane owns the
// child pipeline (admission economics, design §4): a Volcano Limit/Unique is
// already cheap per-tuple and PG's pull already stops a lane pipeline lazily,
// so ownership here buys chain continuity (no per-tuple root adapter between
// the breaker emit and the limit/dedup — and future within-pipeline fusion),
// never a new layer over a refused child.
//
//   Limit  (Pattern 2, DuckDB streaming limit): counts in the node's own
//          LimitState (lstate/position — C's cross-call state, so a Volcano
//          fallback at any call boundary is byte-safe), delivers the boundary
//          tuple via `Paused`, reports `Finished` on the next driver round —
//          the source is never pulled past the boundary tuple's batch, and
//          quals/projections are never evaluated past the limit (C's LIMIT
//          stops calling its child). OFFSET tuples are pulled + discarded,
//          exactly as C's LIMIT_RESCAN skip loop pulls them.
//   Unique (over the sort breaker): adjacent-dedup streaming op — one sorted
//          tuple in, 0..1 group heads out, via `nodeunique::lane_unique_feed`
//          (the SAME grouping-equality program + prev-slot copy exec_unique
//          runs — reused, not reimplemented).
//
// Row-identity note (LIMIT without ORDER BY): C returns whichever rows its
// plan yields first. The lane's owned pipelines emit C's rows in C's order BY
// CONSTRUCTION — scan pipelines walk the same pages/TID runs in the same
// order, and breaker read-backs delegate to the same tuplesort / hash-table
// retrieves — so the lane's first k tuples are C's first k tuples,
// byte-identically (verified by the full regress off/on comparison).
//
// Refused shapes (each byte-safe on the Volcano fallback):
//   * LIMIT ... WITH TIES — needs boundary-tuple retention + the sort-peer
//     equality walk (LIMIT_WINDOWEND_TIES); staged later. (PG's Limit node
//     has no percent-limit form — nothing to gate.)
//   * Limit/Unique over a BARE scan — the scan hooks themselves refuse
//     standalone ownership (per-tuple emission through the pull adapter with
//     no batch consumer above = pure adapter overhead); a Volcano
//     Limit/Unique over the refused scan IS C's shape, so taking ownership
//     adds a layer with no consumer benefit.
//   * Limit over a bare HashJoin — needs a two-TupleOp chain driver
//     (JoinProbe → LimitOp); staged with the next chain generalization.
//   * Backward/scrollable cursors — a scrollable/backward cursor forces
//     randomAccess on the Sort child (refused by `sort_fusible`), Limit
//     never sees EXEC_FLAG_MARK (init assert), Unique never sees

// HashAggregate above a Gather — the plan shape the planner picks when

// GROUP BYs) — as a lane breaker build fed by the GATHER MACHINERY AS A
// SOURCE. The workers stay row-path (they only scan/filter/project into the
// shm_mq); the leader's half becomes lane pipelines on the one breaker node:
//
//   1. build: exec_gather (REUSED VERBATIM, per pull: worker launch,
//      round-robin nowait queue reads, leader participation, projection) →
//      staged fold sink / per-row breaker sink
//   2. emit:  HashAggSource → HashAggEmit → RootAdapter (one group per pull)
//
// The Append house rule applies: the node's OWN drive body is reused, not
// reimplemented — worker launch/teardown, tqueue reads, latch waits,
// leader-participation pulls (`exec_proc_node` on the partial plan — the
// leader's local child stays row-path; parallel-aware scans refuse the lane
// via the parallel gate), deferred-rescan chgParam, and the per-pull CFI are
// all `exec_gather`'s. Only the consumer changes: each returned slot feeds
// the breaker sink instead of returning through the Volcano boundary, so the
// agg consumes C's rows in C's arrival order and the built table is
// byte-identical to `exec_agg` over `exec_gather`'s.
//
// Feed choice mirrors the agg-over-join composition: the staged fold feed
// (`StagedFoldAggSink` — batched transition folds; K2's deferred batched
// probe when the grouping key is single and kernel-hostable) when the agg
// carries a lanefold plan, the per-row `HashAggBuildSink` otherwise. Staged
// by-ref values are copied into the per-batch arena at accept, so the
// funnel slot's transport-lifetime tuple (live only until the next queue
// receive) is never held across rows.
//
// Refuse-set (each byte-safe on the Volcano fallback):
//   * agg-side: `agg_hash_breaker_admissible`, verbatim (grouping sets /
//     DISTINCT / ordered-set / merge-phase — notably the parallel FINALIZE
//     half of a partial-agg plan, whose AGGSPLIT deserialization the breaker
//     does not own; ticked under aggbuild per offered call).
//   * dynamic EPQ / non-forward pulls (§4 model-incompatible; per call).
//   * GatherMerge stays Volcano: the planner puts a hash agg above
//     GatherMerge only when the merge order is useful elsewhere — no such
//     analytics-charter shape exists; a sorted GroupAggregate over GatherMerge is a
//     different (sorted-agg) breaker and refuses via the dispatch match.
//   * kill switch `PGRUST_LANE_V2_AGGGATHER=0` (A/B tooling; default ON).

//   * `ExecProjectSRF` interleaves per-tuple context resets between (not
