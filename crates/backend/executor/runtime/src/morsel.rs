//! Morsel source vocabulary: granule-addressed pipeline input.
//!
//! Sizing is in GRANULES (the source's smallest indivisible claim unit —
//! for pgrcolumnar in M1 a granule is the 8,192-row unit of format.rs; heap
//! sources will present block-range units). Two hard rules the runtime
//! enforces on every claim (lit-review §5.2):
//!   1. never split a granule — claims are whole-granule ranges;
//!   2. never cross a hard boundary (pgrcolumnar row-group or dictionary-epoch
//!      edge) within one claim, so per-epoch memos (dict-eval, codehist,
//!      gmemo) stay worker-coherent and every kernel invocation sees a
//!      single dictionary snapshot.
//!
//! The scan side implements this trait in M1; M0 tests use
//! [`SyntheticMorselSource`].
