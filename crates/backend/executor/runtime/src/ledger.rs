//! Admission ledger v2 (single-executor migration Phase 0.1, WS-B): the ONE
//! width authority for the runtime. Slot-indexed 1:1 with the scheduler's
//! slot array; per-entry granted/target width words arbitrate how many
//! workers may serve each admitted resource group.
//!
//! Split-altitude discipline (copied from the Membership mutex, sched.rs):
//! `inner` is touched only at MEMBERSHIP EVENTS (admit / retire / target
//! recompute); the per-slot [`EntryWords`] are cache-padded atomics read
//! Relaxed on the hot paths (per pick candidate, per join/leave, per claim
//! boundary). Everything here is ADVISORY width policy: execution safety —
//! the slot word, the pin board, the finalization counter, the permit
//! semaphore — is untouched and owns correctness exactly as before, so
//! every ledger word is Relaxed and a stale read resolves through the
//! ordinary revalidation paths (Retry / the generation gate).
//!
//! LOCK ORDER: membership → ledger.inner, never inverted. `admit` and
//! `retire` run under the scheduler's membership lock (start_rg_locked /
//! release_slot_locked) and take `inner`; the hot-path entries
//! (`try_join` / `leave` / `should_continue` / `renudge` / `wants_workers`)
//! NEVER take `inner` — a worker holding a claim can never deadlock against
//! a submitting leader. The GANG face (`admit_gang` / `settle_gang` /
//! `retire_gang`, PHASE3-CLOSE WS-WIDTH — the audited successor of WS-O
//! wave 2's external face) takes `inner` ALONE from executor leader
//! threads that never hold the membership lock — taking the innermost
//! lock only always respects the order; a gang-face caller must NEVER
//! hold the membership lock (there is no code path that does, and none
//! may be added).
//!
//! # Gang policy lineage (WS-O wave 2 adjudications, all ratified)
//!
//! The gang face carries the WS-O external-face policy VERBATIM (the W4
//! removal deleted the external slab, not the policy): HEADROOM-ONLY
//! grants (never displace admitted pool width; grant MAY BE 0 — the
//! caller MUST have a serial path, Gather's leader-local scan); FROZEN
//! grants (no claim boundaries to shed at; the fairness envelope of
//! freezing stays a fleet measurement before any default-ON); RECOMPUTE
//! PARTICIPATION (active width charged before fair shares; liveness floor
//! target ≥ 1 wins); the COMPOSITION RULE (granted counts ACTIVE width —
//! `settle_gang` records launched/live and only THAT is charged; a
//! consumer must never ALSO clamp itself from the same numbers — ledger
//! clamps width, arm-side DOPCAP clamps footprint); LEADER NOT COUNTED
//! (C parity — parallel_leader_participation rides free); CAPACITY
//! FAIL-OPEN (at most [`MAX_GANG_ENTRIES`] concurrent gangs; past it
//! `admit_gang` refuses (None) and the caller keeps today's uncapped
//! launch path — asserted in tests, never a production panic).
//!
//! Events:
//! - ARRIVAL NUDGE — [`AdmissionLedger::admit`] registers the entry and
//!   recomputes every target (incumbents over their new target shed at
//!   their next claim boundary via [`AdmissionLedger::should_continue`]);
//!   the returned [`ArrivalNudge`] carries the wake hint and the
//!   advertises flag (sub-JOIN_THRESHOLD entries never set an active bit
//!   and never wake the pool — the caller executes alone).
//! - WORKER-FREED RE-PICK — [`AdmissionLedger::leave`] /
//!   [`AdmissionLedger::retire`] return wake hints; freed capacity flows to
//!   under-target entries through the pick filter
//!   ([`AdmissionLedger::wants_workers`]) — the leaving worker re-picks on
//!   its own, the hint only covers PARKED workers when a slot transitions
//!   back to joinable.
//! - BOUNDED RE-NUDGE — an under-target entry at a claim boundary may
//!   request one wake ([`AdmissionLedger::renudge`]), budgeted by
//!   `renudge_left` (refilled at every recompute) so a stuck entry cannot
//!   wake-storm.
//!
//! # Unified gang entries (PHASE3-CLOSE WS-WIDTH — the ONE width authority)
//!
//! `PGRUST_RUNTIME_WIDTH_UNIFIED` retargets non-pool gangs onto the POOL
//! face's grant algebra: a gang admission is an ordinary row of the ONE
//! entry table (`LedgerEntry::Gang`, allocated past the slot region),
//! charged BY the one recompute (`recompute_locked` walks the one table:
//! gang ACTIVE width is a fixed off-the-top charge, then pool fair shares
//! split the remainder), read by the one snapshot, bounded by the one gang
//! capacity ([`MAX_GANG_ENTRIES`], the successor of the external cap).
//! Gang entries are **NON-SHEDDING (frozen)**: bgworkers have no claim
//! boundaries, so the grant is a fixed charge for the entry's lifetime.
//! The WS-O policy invariants above (headroom-only, grant-may-be-0,
//! frozen, leader-not-counted, anti-double-clamp, advisory-only,
//! per-startup cadence, capacity fail-open) carry VERBATIM to gang
//! entries; `admit_gang` takes `inner` ALONE (lock-order law above). The
//! WS-O external slab this face superseded was removed by the W4 audited
//! removal (this commit); the policy lineage section above preserves the
//! adjudications.
//!
//! Fair-share remainder: targets split the core budget equally over
//! admitted entries; the remainder is assigned in slot order here, and
//! WHICH entry actually receives spare width is resolved by the
//! pass-ordered stride pick composed with `wants_workers` — the ratified
//! "pass/stride stays on Slot, the ledger consumes it via the pick filter"
//! shape (integration contract 1c). The ledger never duplicates pass
//! accounting.
//!
//! Composition rule (integration contract 1c, recorded for the arm
//! plumbing increments): the LEDGER clamps WIDTH from cache headroom
//! (Σ target_i × bytes_i ≤ cache budget); arm-side DOPCAP clamps FOOTPRINT
//! at the granted width — never both from the same numbers, or the
//! combined effect over-narrows. Inc-1 ships `cache_bytes = u64::MAX`
//! (unbounded) and no arm supplies footprints: the mechanism is tested but
//! inert.
//!
//! Liveness floor: an admitted entry's target is ≥ 1 while it remains
//! admitted (admission ⇔ unfinalized work: retire runs when the RG leaves
//! its slot). The floor wins over the cache clamp by design — it may
//! transiently overshoot the cache budget by (entries − 1) × bytes in the
//! worst case, which is the price of the no-wedge guarantee the loom
//! liveness model asserts.
//!
//! Design/spec home: this module doc + notes/se-ws-b-ledger.md (per the
//! integration contract's R-V2DOC ruling, docs/design/morsel-runtime-v2.md
//! is assembled at integrate, not created by any workstream branch).
