//! ParallelSink — the M2 sink contract and its TaskSet plumbing (M2 PREP).
//!
//! Design authority: docs/design/m2-sinks.md (this lane's companion doc;
//! donor mapping = nodeagg::merge / Stage-4 radix exchange + paremit,
//! nodeagg::pardistinct, the stringhash tables, refsort + rule-2 rowref).
//! Parent plan: docs/design/parallelism-redesign-2026-07.md §2.2 / §5-M2.
//!
//! STATUS (m2-integration): TWO production sinks ride this module —
//! the M2 aggregation sink (two-set [`ParallelSink`]: execmain
//! lanev2/runtime_agg.rs + nodeagg/sink.rs) and the M2 distinct sink
//! (three-set [`SealedParallelSink`]: lanev2/runtime_distinct.rs +
//! nodeagg/pardistinct.rs). Both engage only under `PGRUST_RUNTIME=1` +
//! their arm knobs (guc_tables::runtime_pool); off-path the runtime crate
//! is dead code (M0 contract). The toy-sink test suites below are the
//! compatibility oracle for the plumbing — they ride unmodified from both
//! lanes (see docs/design/m2-sinks.md §7.1 for why both DAG shapes are
//! kept rather than unified).
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! One logical pipeline breaker (aggregation table, distinct set, top-N
//! heap) becomes TWO task sets on the runtime, produced by
//! [`sink_tasksets`]:
//!
//! ```text
//!   ACCEPT task set (source = the data pipeline's morsels)
//!     run_morsel  → fork-on-first-touch per worker, then
//!                   ParallelSink::accept_local (thread-local, no shared
//!                   mutation, no locks on the row path)
//!     finalize    → SEAL (last-worker-out, single-threaded): collect the
//!                   generation-matching LocalStates for the combine set
//!   COMBINE task set (source = the sink's partition space, deps=[accept])
//!     run_morsel  → ParallelSink::combine(part, &locals) — each partition
//!                   claimed exactly once; single writer per partition
//!     finalize    → ParallelSink::finalize (last-worker-out,
//!                   single-threaded, MINIMAL — see the paremit resolution
//!                   in m2-sinks.md §4: emission belongs in combine;
//!                   finalize is publish + epilogue)
//! ```
//!
//! # H1 protection (structural, not conventional)
//!
//! Every LocalState is keyed by the runtime lifecycle's [`Generation`]:
//! - the scheduler hands the plumbing its generation at publish time
//!   ([`crate::rg::TaskSetWork::bind_generation`]), strictly before any
//!   worker can claim a morsel;
//! - a worker slot holding a Local of a DIFFERENT generation is dropped and
//!   re-forked, never accepted into (aborted-init leftovers are
//!   unconsumable by construction);
//! - SEAL takes only generation-matching Locals; mismatches are dropped and
//!   counted ([`SinkTaskSets::stale_locals_dropped`]);
//! - COMBINE refuses (fail-closed, no-op) unless the sealed generation
//!   equals its own bound generation.
//!
//! Aborts need no sink-side handling beyond this: the scheduler's
//! generation gate already refuses morsels of a closed generation, and
//! last-worker-out skips `finalize` on aborted RGs, so an aborted sink's
//! Locals are simply dropped with the RG.
