//! The scheduler core: 128-slot global array, morsel claiming, and the
//! LAST-WORKER-OUT FINALIZATION PROTOCOL (SIGMOD'21 §2.4 via
//! notes/morsel-lit-review.md §1.3; correctness-critical — modeled in
//! tests/loom.rs before any perf work, per redesign doc §2.1).
//!
//! # The finalization protocol, exactly
//!
//! Finishing a pipeline must (a) run its finalization AT MOST ONCE, and
//! (b) only after ALL workers finished their in-flight tasks — an empty
//! morsel queue does NOT mean the pipeline is done (literature mistake #2).
//!
//! 1. PUBLISH-TARGET-BEFORE-CLAIM: a worker stores the slot index it is
//!    about to work in the pin board BEFORE reading the slot word.
//! 2. EXHAUSTED → INVALIDATE: the first worker to find the task set's
//!    cursor exhausted (or its generation dead) CASes the slot word from
//!    valid to invalid; the CAS winner is the unique coordinator.
//! 3. MARK: the coordinator scans the pin board and swaps every entry still
//!    pinned to the dying slot (its own included) for a finalization
//!    marker, then adds the number of marked workers to the task set's
//!    finalization counter.
//! 4. SETTLE: every worker clears its pin after finishing its in-flight task;
//!    if it finds a marker it decrements the counter. The counter may go
//!    TRANSIENTLY NEGATIVE (marked workers can decrement before the
//!    coordinator's add lands).
//! 5. LAST OUT: whoever moves the counter to zero is provably the last
//!    worker out; it runs finalize, then activates the RG's next task set
//!    in the SAME slot (or completes the RG and admits the next queued RG).
//!
//! Safety note (why `settle`'s ownership lookup cannot dangle): the slot's
//! ownership entry is only replaced/cleared by LAST OUT, which requires the
//! counter to reach zero, which requires every marked worker's decrement —
//! so a marked worker always finds its task set still owned at settle time.
//! Conversely a worker whose pin was marked can never observe the slot's
//! NEXT occupant as valid: the next occupant is published by last-out,
//! which its own pending decrement blocks.
//!
//! Scheduling policy (M5-4, docs/design/inter-query-scheduling.md §5.3 /
//! docs/design/m5-planner.md §3): STRIDE / FAIR-SHARE at equal shares. The
//! pick is the lowest-`pass` active slot; each executed task advances its
//! slot's pass by `stride × cpu_ns` (stride = STRIDE1/priority; every RG
//! holds p_0 in M5-4, so shares are equal — decaying priorities + p_min are
//! M5-5). Equal-pass ties prefer the slot whose RG's leader session the
//! picking worker is sticky-bound to (§5.2 session-affine tiebreak,
//! equal-pass-only per the design's §10 default), then lowest index. The
//! M4 Maintenance preference is evaluated BEFORE the stride pick (§3.2
//! reconciliation) and maintenance passes charge normally, so background
//! cycles keep their ≤ ~1-task start bound without ever starving foreground.
//!
//! Invariants the activation preserves:
//! - ONE ACTIVE RG ⇒ the pick is forced (the only set bit) with no pass
//!   reads — provably today's FIFO pick; the single-query benchmark case is
//!   bit-identical by construction.
//! - `PGRUST_RUNTIME_STRIDE=0` (kill switch) restores the M0 FIFO
//!   lowest-index pick outright.
//! - Pass/stride/session words are Relaxed and ADVISORY: they order the
//!   pick, never execution safety — a stale pick revalidates through the
//!   slot word into Retry (same argument as the maintenance mask).
//!
//! PIPELINE-DAG DISPATCH (M5+1 increment 1, m5-planner §3.6 — independent-
//! subtree overlap ONLY; `PGRUST_RUNTIME_PIPELINE_DAG=1`, default OFF):
//! instead of walking an RG's task sets one slot at a time, publish EVERY
//! task set whose dependencies have all finalized, each in its own slot —
//! independent hash-build sides / subqueries / UNION ALL branches overlap. A
//! task set with unmet deps is NOT SUBMITTED: it occupies no slot, queues
//! nowhere, and no worker can wait on it — which is the increment's
//! structural deadlock argument (the wait graph over RUNNING entities has no
//! dependency edges at all; workers never hold-and-wait across task sets —
//! one claim, one morsel, permits donated on declared blocking). A
//! finishing pipeline's finalize marks its dep edge satisfied and publishes
//! the newly-ready pipelines: the deepest into its own (retained) slot,
//! the rest into free slots — capacity shortfalls defer (counted), and the
//! deferred pipeline re-publishes when one of the query's own pipelines
//! finishes, so the RG always holds ≥1 slot while work remains (progress
//! guaranteed without any cross-RG wait). Fairness: the QUERY is the
//! fair-share principal — all of an RG's slots advance ONE stride account
//! ([`ResourceGroup::pass_account`], the sum of their quanta) mirrored into
//! each slot's pass word (one-task-bounded staleness, advisory); within a
//! query at equal pass the pick prefers the DEEPER pipeline (§3.6
//! dependency-depth priority, ties by submission order). OFF (the kill
//! switch, this increment's default) is today's sequential walk,
//! byte-identical; ON with a single-pipeline RG degenerates to the same
//! pick and pass sequence by construction (the single-wide-pipeline flatness anchor).
//! Streaming across pipeline seams is inc-3 (evidence-gated, NOT here);
//! tail/ramp readahead overlap is inc-2 (also not here).
