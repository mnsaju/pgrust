//! §2.9 uring duties of the pool worker loop (M1 lane C wiring):
//!
//! - RING LIFECYCLE: each worker creates its own io_uring at loop start
//!   (`aio_seams::uring_worker_ring_init` — owner-submits-only; the ring is
//!   marked boundary-reaped so WaitIO waiters may park on IoTokens) and
//!   tears it down at loop exit. The ring id registers with the runtime
//!   worker struct ([`crate::Runtime::worker_ring`]).
//! - BOUNDARY REAPING: at every task boundary the loop calls
//!   `uring_boundary_reap` — a non-blocking CQE drain; completions run
//!   (bufmgr io_wref clear + TerminateBufferIO + IoToken complete → Waiter
//!   unpark-all) and collected issuer pins drop. Completions ride the
//!   existing ~1-2ms task cadence.
//! - IoGuard SEAMS: this module installs `aio_seams::io_permit_release` /
//!   `io_permit_reacquire` — the §2.8 declared-blocking-section hooks. A
//!   pool worker that blocks inside a task (first caller: aio_uring's
//!   genuinely-pending `uring_buf_read_wait` paths, AFTER the peek-complete
//!   elision) releases its execution permit so a standby absorbs the core,
//!   and reacquires it when the wait ends. Capacity moves; the task stays
//!   on its thread with its pin-board entry and finalization-marker
//!   obligations intact (see [`crate::sync::Semaphore::io_section`], the
//!   in-crate RAII form of the same discipline — the seam pair is its
//!   split enter/exit shape, split because the release and the reacquire
//!   happen on opposite sides of a foreign blocking wait).
//!
//! Inert by default: this module only runs on pool worker threads, the pool
//! only spawns under `PGRUST_RUNTIME=1`, and every seam call is
//! `is_installed`-guarded (aio_uring absent — e.g. unit tests, non-Linux —
//! degrades to no-ops).
