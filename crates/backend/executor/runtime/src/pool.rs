//! Worker pool driver: `cores + K` threads running the worker loop against
//! one [`Runtime`].
//!
//! Layering: this module owns only the LOOP and (for tests) std-thread
//! spawning + join. Production spawning goes through launch_backend's
//! rtpool glue (synthetic pids via the guarded reserve_child_pid counter,
//! wpool-style warm prelude, standard child stack size) which calls
//! [`WorkerPool::spawn_with`] with its own spawner. Runtime workers are
//! EXECUTORS, not sessions: no PGPROC, no bgworker slot, no reaper entry,
//! and — deliberately — NO wakeup-registry entry (they park on the
//! runtime's eventcount, not a latch), so the pid-collision/registry-hijack
//! wedge class (notes/pardistinct-contention-fix.md) has no surface here.
//! Any FUTURE latch use by pool threads must follow the rekey discipline
//! (waiteventset_seams::rekey_wakeup_registry) — documented, not needed.
