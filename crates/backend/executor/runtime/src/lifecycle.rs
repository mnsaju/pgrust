//! Task lifecycle state machine for the morsel runtime.
//!
//! PROVENANCE: extracted as a DESIGN DONOR from the accepted scan-task
//! lifecycle, `morsel/real-scan-v93-20260710` @ f4f905dd8
//! (`crates/backend/executor/execmain/src/scan_task.rs`, "fix(execmain):
//! linearize scan-task shutdown", qualified 2026-07-10; journal
//! docs/optimizations/2026-07-10-morsel-real-scan-prerequisite.md). The
//! donor's execparallel/Gather wiring (ParallelShared target, pgrcolumnar scan
//! descriptor claims, plan-shape eligibility walk) is deliberately REMOVED —
//! the new runtime's pool/scheduler own that wiring. What is kept, with the
//! donor's semantics intact:
//!
//! - The combined AtomicU64 CAS lifecycle: publication, open/retired flags,
//!   participant count, and operation count live in ONE atomic word so join
//!   and close share a single ARM-safe linearization order (the donor's
//!   join-vs-close P1 fix; the Loom model below reproduces the donor's).
//! - Query-owned generations: every published execution gets an immutable
//!   generation identity; rescan/reinitialize publishes a NEW generation and
//!   stale handles can never join or migrate into it. Aborted/cancelled
//!   generations are unconsumable by construction (the H1 CaseDict-TLS structural
//!   fix: partial state keyed by a generation dies with it).
//! - Armed participant outcomes: a joined participant must explicitly
//!   `complete()` or `fail()`; an unfinished Drop (error unwind, panic,
//!   forgotten handle) records an error and cancels the generation, so owner
//!   teardown can never report success over an abandoned claim.
//! - Fail-closed admission: joining requires a [`ParticipantOwner`] that
//!   affirmatively permits it and owns stop/liveness for drain;
//!   [`ForeignParticipationDisabled`] is the production default until a
//!   dispatcher supplies that ownership.
//! - Interruptible drain: close-and-wait services interrupts on every timed
//!   wake (repeatedly — later cancel/ProcDie must not be swallowed by an
//!   earlier benign service), retains the FIRST error, and wakes waiters only
//!   on a closed transition to idle (no per-operation Condvar broadcast).
//!
//! Everything here is inert until the runtime's pool/scheduler (lane B) and
//! an execution owner arm it; no production caller exists at M0.

// MERGE NOTE (m0-integration): synchronization comes from the crate's
// loom/std shim so lane B's scheduler models (tests/loom.rs) explore the
// lifecycle's own edges too — under `--cfg loom` every CAS, mutex, and
// condvar below is a loom-checked type. `Arc` stays std per the shim's
// rules (sync.rs). Semantics are the donor's, unchanged.
