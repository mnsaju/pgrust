//! TaskSet runtime state + the pieces of the last-worker-out finalization
//! protocol that live per-worker (the pin board) and per-slot (the slot
//! word).
//!
//! PROVENANCE: written fresh from SIGMOD'21 §2.3/§2.4 (Wagner/Kohn/Neumann)
//! as distilled in notes/morsel-lit-review.md §1.2–1.3 and ratified in
//! docs/design/inter-query-scheduling.md §4. The design docs name a
//! `qsched.rs` harvest candidate on the shelved inter-query-scheduling /
//! proto-workstealing branches; verified 2026-07 (this lane): no such file
//! exists on any branch — the correction in the redesign doc §4 ("no loom
//! dependency or model exists on any branch; aspirational references only")
//! extends to the scheduler core itself. Everything here is new work.
