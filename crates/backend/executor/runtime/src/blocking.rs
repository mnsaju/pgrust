//! Declared-blocking-section FACADE for spill I/O (M3.5 inc-1; design
//! authority docs/design/m3.5-spill.md §6.1, redesign §2.8).
//!
//! [`crate::sync::Semaphore::io_section`] has a hard caller contract: the
//! calling thread must actually HOLD an execution permit (it releases
//! unconditionally; a permit-less call would inflate the count). Pool
//! workers hold one across the whole scheduling step (pool.rs); the phase-1
//! pinned-regime helpers and the leader hold NONE. This facade lets the
//! spill substrate bracket every spill syscall region unconditionally:
//!
//! - on a REGISTERED pool-worker thread the section is ARMED — the permit
//!   is donated for the region (a standby absorbs the core) and reacquired
//!   on drop, exactly `io_section`;
//! - on every other thread it is a NO-OP.
//!
//! The concurrency semantics are entirely `io_section`'s; the facade adds a
//! thread-local registration gate. Loom coverage: tests/loom.rs
//! `facade_standby_absorption` (the §2.8 standby-absorption model driven
//! through this facade). Call sites live in the spill substrate (the
//! spillset crate); registration belongs to the pool's worker loop (and to
//! the loom pool-loop emulation).
