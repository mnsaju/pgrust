//! Runtime Funnel — the parallel row-EMIT boundary (gather-elimination Phase 2,
//! the one genuinely NEW subsystem).
//!
//! PROVENANCE: `scratchpad/night/research-parallelize-rowemit.md` §4 ("Runtime
//! Funnel") + `gather-elimination-implementation-plan.md` §Phase-2. Everything
//! here is new work; it ports the *policy* of `nodegather.rs::gather_readnext`
//! (round-robin, stick-until-block, drop-drained-reader) and the LIMIT
//! push-down shape, over an in-process transport instead of `shm_mq`.
//!
//! # Why this is a new subsystem, not a new `ParallelSink`
//!
//! Every existing runtime taskset is a **pipeline breaker**: N workers fold
//! morsels into thread-local partials, then a last-worker-out SEAL + COMBINE +
//! finalize emits a small folded result (`sink.rs`). Row emission cannot fold —
//! it must interleave PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION: workers produce rows into
//! buffers while a consumer drains them to the client wire concurrently. This
//! is the first **non-breaker** (streaming) taskset. See the invariant analysis
//! below for why a concurrent drain does not violate the last-worker-out /
//! generation protocol.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! ```text
//!   worker 0 ─push─▶ SpscRing 0 ─┐
//!   worker 1 ─push─▶ SpscRing 1 ─┤ round-robin
//!      …                         ├── FunnelDrain ──▶ leader (pure consumer)
//!   worker k ─push─▶ SpscRing k ─┘   (stick-until-block)      │
//!                                                     dest.receive_slot(wire)
//! ```
//!
//! - **Transport = in-process bounded SPSC ring** (this module), NOT `shm_mq`:
//!   the runtime is threads-in-one-process, so payloads cross by ownership/
//!   pointer with no shared-memory ring copy (research §3 "Replace the
//!   transport"). Bounded capacity IS the memory budget and the back-pressure
//!   knob.
//! - **Producer side** = a worker's [`FunnelProducer`]: append; when the ring
//!   is full, [`FunnelProducer::push_blocking`] parks the worker (the caller
//!   brackets the park in the K-standby blocking-permit section so a standby
//!   absorbs the core — `crate::blocking`). A parked producer wakes when the
//!   drain frees a slot, or when demand is closed (LIMIT).
//! - **Consumer side** = the leader's [`FunnelDrain`]: a PURE consumer running
//!   the ported `gather_readnext` policy. It never produces, never claims a
//!   morsel, never touches the pin board or `fin_counter`.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! UNORDERED (arrival order, like `Gather`) is the ONLY mode built here — the
//! biggest coverage gap (`scan-passthrough`) and the deadlock-safe baseline.
//! Ordered emit (the `nodegathermerge` binary heap over these same rings) is a
//! later increment; the ring transport is order-source-agnostic so it drops in.
//!
//! # INVARIANT ANALYSIS — streaming taskset vs. last-worker-out / generation
//!
//! The `sched.rs` last-worker-out protocol and the `sink.rs` H1 generation
//! discipline were proven for BREAKERS (fold → SEAL → single-writer COMBINE →
//! at-most-once finalize). A concurrently-draining taskset is a new lifecycle
//! shape. The correctness argument that it does NOT violate those invariants:
//!
//! 1. **The drain is invisible to the finalization protocol.** Last-worker-out
//!    is a protocol among POOL WORKERS via the pin board + `fin_counter`
//!    (`taskset.rs`): a coordinator marks pinned workers, each marked worker
//!    decrements on finishing its in-flight morsel, whoever hits zero runs
//!    `finalize()` exactly once. The funnel drain is the LEADER acting as a
//!    pure consumer: it is not a pool worker, holds no pin-board entry, and
//!    never touches `fin_counter`/`cursor`/the sizer. So every last-worker-out
//!    invariant is preserved unchanged — the drain is a reader of SPSC rings
//!    that the protocol does not know exists.
//!
//! 2. **`finalize()` becomes a no-op join point, not a COMBINE.** A row-emit
//!    taskset has nothing to fold, so its `finalize()` does no COMBINE; its
//!    only job is to publish "all producers done" (mark every ring done) so the
//!    drain reaches EOF. This runs AFTER the last worker's last morsel, i.e.
//!    after every producer has stopped pushing — so it cannot race a live
//!    producer. The rings outlive `finalize()` (owned by the funnel `Arc`, not
//!    by any worker) and the drain keeps consuming buffered rows until each ring
//!    is done AND empty.
//!
//! 3. **Generation keying is preserved.** The rings are allocated per taskset
//!    publish and keyed by generation exactly like fold partials
//!    (`TaskSetWork::bind_generation`): a stale generation's ring is never
//!    entered because the fail-closed armed join refuses the task. A row
//!    emitted BEFORE finalize is safe because it is a COPY/owned MinimalTuple
//!    in the ring, not a borrow of per-worker fold state that COMBINE would
//!    later touch — there is no COMBINE to race. (This is the H1 re-proof the
//!    research flagged as highest-risk: emitting before finalize is sound
//!    precisely because emission transfers OWNERSHIP into the ring.)
//!
//! 4. **No back-pressure deadlock — because the leader is a PURE drain.**
//!    A producer parks only when its ring is FULL; a full ring always has data
//!    to drain, so the drain can always make progress. The drain parks only
//!    when EVERY live ring is EMPTY; an empty ring means its producer is
//!    running (or done), never parked-on-full. So "all producers parked" and
//!    "drain parked" cannot hold simultaneously: if any producer is parked its
//!    ring is full → the drain is runnable, not parked. The only remaining wait
//!    is the drain blocking on a slow CLIENT (`receive_slot`), which is the
//!    intended end-to-end back-pressure: client unblocks → drain consumes →
//!    ring frees → producer wakes. A cycle would require the drain to also be a
//!    PRODUCER (needing a full ring to drain before it can produce); keeping
//!    the leader a pure consumer removes that edge. This is why leader
//!    participation is deliberately NOT implemented (a defensible divergence
//!    from PG's `parallel_leader_participation`; better for high-fan-out where
//!    the leader is wire-bound anyway).
//!
//! 5. **LIMIT / early stop is cooperative and lost-wake-free.** The drain, on
//!    reaching the bound, calls [`RowFunnel::close_demand`] which sets a flag
//!    and wakes every producer parklot. A producer checks the flag at every
//!    ring-full park wait and at claim boundaries; a parked-on-full producer
//!    wakes, sees closed, stops, and marks its ring done. The wake bumps the
//!    parklot epoch BEFORE notifying (ParkLot's lost-wakeup-free protocol), so
//!    a producer about to park after the close still observes it. We wake
//!    EAGERLY (per push / per close), deliberately NOT PG14's "wake at ¼-full"
//!    batching, which the research flagged as a LIMIT-latency pothole.
