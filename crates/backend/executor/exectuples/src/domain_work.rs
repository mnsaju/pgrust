//! DOMAIN-WORK tripwire counters (proportionality-audit, 2026-07-15).
//!
//! The bug family this watches: per-{plan, open, execution, worker, claim,
//! epoch} work sized by a DOMAIN (dict NDV, row-group count x column count,
//! granule counts, pool width) where the useful work is O(touched data).
//! Confirmed members: CaseDict's exprkey gndv-sized cache fills, the footer_ndv
//! per-plan reparse, dictkey's dense-array zeroing, the ~10M-group byref aggcontext
//! floor. Fix lanes close members; THIS module keeps the class from
//! silently re-entering: every knowingly domain-sized operation left in a
//! hot path ticks its size here, the scan-shutdown SFIN marker dumps the
//! totals next to the touched-side counters (cb_granules / cb_windows),
//! and gates can watch the domain:touched ratio per query class in any
//! banked postmaster log.
//!
//! Discipline:
//! - Tick ONLY domain-sized work (full-domain clears/fills/walks — e.g. a
//!   kill-switch full-clear arm, an eager whole-dict fill, a dense dict
//!   pointer-table build). Proportional (touched-walk) arms do NOT tick —
//!   the counter is the family's exposure meter, not a profiler.
//! - PROCESS-WIDE relaxed atomics (this crate is no_std; no TLS): serial
//!   gate legs read per-query-exact totals; parallel drives smear across
//!   whichever emitter drains first — fine for a tripwire, documented so
//!   nobody reads worker-attribution into the numbers. Tick sites are
//!   per-epoch cold; contention is negligible by construction.
//! - Emission is marker-gated (PGRUST_WFIN, the SFIN channel) so default
//!   runs pay nothing observable beyond the cold adds.
