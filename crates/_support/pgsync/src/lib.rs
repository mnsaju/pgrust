//! pgsync — THE single lock library (permit-s1 step 1; authority:
//! `docs/design/permit-scheduler.md` @ 521676a30, contract §2).
//!
//! One crate, three worlds; this is the ONLY place a world-selection cfg for
//! synchronization may appear. Call sites import pgsync types UNCONDITIONALLY
//! and never contain `cfg(loom)` / `cfg(pgrust_sim)` for sync:
//!
//! | world  | cfg               | arm |
//! |--------|-------------------|-----|
//! | native | neither           | `pub use std::sync::…` / `std::thread::…` re-exports — zero cost, IDENTICAL types (G1 asm letter) |
//! | loom   | `--cfg loom`      | loom's checked types; API deltas vs std papered CENTRALLY here (see the papering table below) |
//! | sim    | `--cfg pgrust_sim`| std-backed permit-hooked wrappers; wait/wake lists owned by the wrapper so every wakee is a seeded pick |
//!
//! Laws inherited from the runtime crate's `sync.rs` (the repo's first loom
//! pattern, absorbed here) — these are CRATE LAW for every consumer:
//! - `Arc` (and `Weak`) stay `std::sync` everywhere: loom's `Arc` does not
//!   coerce to `Arc<dyn Trait>` and we only use `Arc` for ownership of
//!   immutable or internally-synchronized data.
//! - No statics hold loom types (loom primitives are not
//!   const-constructible); all modeled state is instance-owned.
//!   `OnceLock`-mediated init is the sanctioned pattern for unavoidable
//!   globals — which is exactly why the loom arm's `OnceLock`/`Once` are
//!   std-backed (papering row L3 below), NOT loom composites. For
//!   process-global MODELED state (const-init static slabs/registries) the
//!   sanctioned exception is [`process_global!`] (`global` module): plain
//!   static native/sim, per-iteration lazy state under loom.
//! - Poison-tolerant acquisition goes through [`lock`] (the repo's
//!   `unwrap_or_else(e.into_inner())` discipline; loom's Mutex never poisons
//!   but keeps the API; the sim wrapper propagates std poisoning).
//!
//! What the sim wrappers are NOT (contract §2.2): no product-semantics
//! change, no atomic interception (`atomic` is a std re-export under sim —
//! with one runnable thread every atomic op is totally ordered by the
//! schedule; do not "improve" this), no green threads, no lock-free
//! reimplementation. A sim wrapper is a std primitive PLUS permit
//! bookkeeping. If a wrapper type is ever needed on native, the design is
//! being violated — stop and escalate.
//!
//! Loom papering table (API deltas vs std live HERE, nowhere else — worklog
//! `notes/permit-s1-sync.md` carries the running delta table):
//! - L1 non-const `loom::sync::Mutex::new` → "no statics hold loom types"
//!   law (above).
//! - L2 loom HAS `Barrier` (0.7.2, contrary to the design's expectation) —
//!   re-exported directly; no composite needed.
//! - L3 loom lacks `Once`/`OnceLock` → std-backed under loom (models must
//!   not RACE lazy inits through them; the `once` lint arm keeps the class
//!   enumerated; a checked composite is a later increment if a model needs
//!   one).
//! - L4 loom lacks `thread::sleep` → `yield_now` semantics (existing
//!   loomfast practice).
//! - L5 loom lacks `thread::scope` → deliberately ABSENT under loom (no
//!   model needs it; recorded choice per contract §2.3).
//! - L6 loom `mpsc` has `channel` only → `sync_channel` absent under loom
//!   (composite when a model needs it).
//!
//! The scheduler seam: the sim arm calls [`sim::hooks`] (pinned in WS-SYNC's
//! first commit; WS-CORE owns `src/sim/**` and implements the scheduler
//! behind it). With no hooks installed the sim wrappers degrade to plain std
//! behavior — a sim binary without the permit scheduler behaves exactly as
//! today's (sim-net-e2e / dst-smoke unchanged).
