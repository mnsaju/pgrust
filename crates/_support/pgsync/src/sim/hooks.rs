//! The WS-CORE seam (permit-s1 contract §2.1): the scheduler hook API the
//! sim-world wrappers call at every interception point. PINNED in WS-SYNC's
//! first pushed commit so WS-CORE develops against a fixed surface; WS-CORE
//! owns this file from then on (refinements are CORE's to make, with a
//! coordination row in both worklogs).
//!
//! Contract vocabulary (one call class per interception point): `block_on`,
//! `touch`, `timed_park`, `spawn`, `exit`, `pick_waiter`. WS-SYNC additions
//! required to make the wrapper protocol complete (deviations recorded in
//! `notes/permit-s1-sync.md` §deviations):
//! - [`SchedulerHooks::wake`] — the second half of every notify/unlock
//!   interception: names the `block_on`-parked thread that a seeded pick
//!   chose, so the scheduler can mark it runnable.
//! - [`SchedulerHooks::current_vpid`] — wrappers enqueue the CALLER in their
//!   wait lists; the scheduler owns thread→vpid identity (registered at the
//!   spawn door), so the wrappers ask rather than duplicate a registry.
//! - [`SchedulerHooks::now_ns`] — SimClock read for wrapper deadline math in
//!   `wait_timeout`-shaped ops (time advances only when nothing is runnable;
//!   P3 §2.4).
//!
//! THE WRAPPER PROTOCOL the scheduler must satisfy (and may rely on):
//! - Every wrapper op runs on a REGISTERED thread (registration at the
//!   launch_backend spawn door / `pgsync::thread` sim spawn prologue).
//! - `block_on(site, kind)` is the park: the caller yields the permit and
//!   the call returns only when the scheduler next grants this thread the
//!   permit (i.e. after some `wake(vpid)` named it, or — for `timed_park` —
//!   after the virtual deadline). Wrappers call it in a PREDICATE LOOP and
//!   re-check their condition on return, so a spurious grant is safe.
//! - Permit transfer happens ONLY at `block_on` / `timed_park` (parks) and,
//!   optionally + seeded, at `touch` (preemption). The query hooks
//!   (`pick_waiter`, `current_vpid`, `now_ns`) and `wake` never yield the
//!   permit.
//! - `wake(vpid)` MAY BE DROPPED when the target is not parked (e.g. it was
//!   preempted at a `touch` and is already runnable). Wrappers therefore use
//!   CHECK-BEFORE-PARK: a waker falsifies the wait predicate (removes the
//!   wakee from the wait list) BEFORE calling `wake`, and a waiter re-checks
//!   its predicate immediately before every park, with no hook call in the
//!   check→park gap (the permit is held across it, so no waker can run
//!   there). NOTE this corrects the originally pinned claim that
//!   enqueue-then-park alone cannot lose a wake — false when a hook sits in
//!   the gap (Condvar's unlock does; adversarial review BLOCKING-1,
//!   2026-07-18). Doc-only correction by WS-SYNC; the trait surface is
//!   unchanged and the wording matches the WS-CORE scheduler's shipped
//!   behavior (wake on a runnable slot is a no-op).
//! - `timed_park` returns `true` when the virtual deadline expired (the
//!   caller decides timeout vs notified by consulting its wait list).
//! - `pick_waiter(site, n)` returns an index in `0..n` drawn from
//!   SimEntropy — every OS-arbitrary choice (which wakee, which next holder,
//!   which sender proceeds) routes through it.
//! - `touch(site, kind)` marks an optional-preemption point (unlock, notify,
//!   send) — the seeded-preemption diversity dial (`PGRUST_SIM_PREEMPT_P`).
//! - Every hook carries the caller's `#[track_caller]` Location: the
//!   watchdog dump and the SCHEDOP log NAME blocked sites symbolically.
//!
//! Install discipline: `install()` once, at corpus boot, BEFORE any thread
//! the scheduler must govern is spawned. Mixed-mode (installing after
//! wrapper ops began parking on the std fallback path) is outside the
//! contract. With nothing installed the wrappers are plain std behavior.
