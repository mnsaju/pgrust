//! The permit scheduler core (contract §3.1; design §1) — the
//! [`SchedulerHooks`] implementation behind the pinned `pgsync::sim::hooks`
//! seam.
//!
//! ONE global permit; exactly one runnable thread at any moment; a thread
//! runs from permit receipt to its next pgsync touch. Mandatory handoff on
//! would-block; optional seeded preemption at non-blocking touches
//! (`PGRUST_SIM_PREEMPT_P`); sleeps/timeouts become `TimedPark` on virtual
//! time, which advances ONLY when nothing is runnable, to the earliest
//! deadline (P3 §2.4 verbatim). Deterministic deadlock (all live slots
//! parked in shims, no timed sleeper) is an immediate pick-fail report of
//! all slots + seed — NOT a watchdog case.
//!
//! Seeding: the picker stream is splitmix64 over a seed that is one 8-byte
//! fill drawn through `pg_strong_random` — the sanctioned SimEntropy funnel
//! keyed by `(PGRUST_SIM_SEED, fill_no)` — so every OS-arbitrary choice is
//! a deterministic function of the master seed.
//!
//! Picking (PERMIT-S2 step 1): the GLOBAL scheduler defaults to PCT —
//! Burckhardt, Kothari, Musuvathi, Nagarakatte, "A Randomized Scheduler
//! with Probabilistic Guarantees of Finding Bugs" (ASPLOS 2010): every
//! thread gets a seeded random priority ≥ d at registration; d−1 seeded
//! priority-change points (step index, target priority d−1…1) are drawn per
//! run over an estimated step budget k; the scheduler always runs the
//! highest-priority RUNNABLE slot, and when the running slot's step counter
//! crosses a change point its priority drops to that point's value. For a
//! bug of depth d over n threads and k steps this finds the bug with
//! probability ≥ 1/(n·k^(d−1)) PER RUN — the guarantee uniform random
//! walks lack. Adaptation notes (granularity honest, ledgered in
//! notes/permit-s2.md): a "step" is a pgsync interception (touch / park),
//! not an instruction; `pick_waiter` wait-list choices stay seeded-uniform
//! (the wrapper passes only `n`, not identities); `Spawn` touches never
//! count as steps nor preempt (the spawn fence's invariant, step-1 shape).
//! `PGRUST_SIM_SCHED_ALGO=uniform` restores the step-1 uniform pick +
//! `PGRUST_SIM_PREEMPT_P` coin; instances default to Uniform so the step-1
//! unit battery drives unchanged schedules.
//!
//! Instance discipline: the scheduler is instance-based (unit batteries
//! construct private instances with private virtual clocks so parallel
//! tests never share state); the product wiring is the ONE lazy global
//! ([`global`]) built from the sim knobs, driving the process-wide SimClock
//! (`pg_clock::sim::advance_ns`, driven mode), watched by THE watchdog, and
//! installed into the hooks seam through [`Router`] (which routes every
//! wrapper op by the CALLING THREAD's TLS registration — the same router
//! serves unit instances).
//!
//! The wrapper-protocol note the trait cannot say for us (ledgered in the
//! worklog as a CORE→SYNC coordination row): `pgsync::thread` spawns
//! register CHILD-side, so the OS could delay a child's registration past
//! its parent's next handoff and fork the schedule on wall luck. The
//! scheduler closes that hole with the SPAWN FENCE: `touch(_, Spawn)`
//! (parent, right after the OS spawn) wall-waits until the child's
//! `spawn()` registration has landed. The wait is outside the model (no
//! SCHEDOP line, no virtual time) and bounded by the child's first
//! statement.
//!
//! TLS-teardown rules (P3 §1.6 as adapted by design §3):
//!  1. quantum-scoped teardown — the spawn-door epilogue runs every
//!     registered teardown hook (waiter::retire_current-class) inside the
//!     exiting thread's FINAL quantum, before deregister
//!     ([`Scheduler::exit_cur`]);
//!  2. sim waiter-slot identity is keyed by vpid (exposed via
//!     [`current_vpid`]), never by SLOT_FREE pop order;
//!  3. join wakes on deregister: exit makes every Join-parked slot runnable
//!     (joiners re-check their predicate — spurious-safe per the wrapper
//!     protocol), and the wake post-dates all shared teardown.
