//! FdwRoutine (foreign/fdwapi.h) vocabulary.

//! C: the FDW handler function returns a palloc'd `FdwRoutine` full of
//! callback pointers, consumed by the planner (GetForeignRelSize/Paths/Plan)
//! and the executor (Begin/Iterate/ReScan/End ForeignScan). In pgrust the
//! provider set is in-tree and closed, so the routine collapses to a tagged
//! provider id; each consuming layer owns the half of the callback table
//! whose types it can name (planner: `FdwPlanRoutine`; executor:
//! `FdwExecRoutine`), installed per-provider at `init_seams()` time and
//! looked up by [`FdwKind`].
