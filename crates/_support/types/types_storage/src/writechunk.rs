//! `WriteChunk` — the storage write path's image argument.
//!
//! C has no counterpart type: `smgrwrite`/`FileWriteV` take a bare `char *`,
//! and `pwritev`'s `iovec` carries no aliasing promise at all. This type is
//! how that same absence of a promise is spelled in Rust.

/// One contiguous image handed to the storage write path.
///
/// **Why this exists instead of `&[u8]`.** The buffer pool writes a page out
/// while holding only a SHARE content lock (`FlushBuffer` and every caller
/// above it), and hint-bit setters mutate that very same shared page image
/// under that very same SHARE lock. A shared reference whose element type is
/// `Freeze` — `&[u8]` — asserts to the compiler that the bytes do not change
/// for the reference's whole lifetime, so minting one over a live shared page
/// is aliasing undefined behaviour. The *data* outcome is not in question: C
/// hands `pwritev` a bare pointer into the same live page and tolerates a torn
/// hint bit by design (a page written with no checksum cannot be invalidated
/// by one), and so do we. What `&[u8]` adds on top of C's behaviour is a
/// promise to the optimizer that is false.
///
/// A `WriteChunk` carries the same `(base, len)` pair, but is not a reference
/// to `u8`: the `PhantomData<&'a UnsafeCell<u8>>` marker keeps the borrow
/// (and the `!Send`/`!Sync`-ness a pinned page image wants) without claiming
/// the bytes are immutable. Crucially the bytes are then never read *through
/// Rust* on the flush path — the only reader is the kernel, via the `iovec`
/// this lowers to, and a kernel read is not an operation of the Rust abstract
/// machine. So there is no Rust-level read to race with the hint-bit writer.
///
/// The layout is deliberately `iovec`-compatible (`#[repr(C)]`, base then
/// length, both pointer-sized) so `&[WriteChunk]` can be reinterpreted as
/// `&[iovec]` at the syscall boundary — the same reinterpretation the fd layer
/// already performs on `std::io::IoSlice`.
