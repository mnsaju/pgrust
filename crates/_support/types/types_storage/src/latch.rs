    // -- the Dekker protocol edges (SetLatch/WaitLatch/ResetLatch) ----------
    //
    // C latch.c orders PLAIN flag accesses with pg_memory_barrier() (a full
    // fence); the port renders each barrier as fence(SeqCst) in the latch
    // crate with the field accesses below (notes/latch-atomics.md — nothing
    // silently weakened; the native bodies here are byte-for-byte what the
    // latch crate open-coded before this refactor, asm letter in
    // notes/dst-latch-loom.md).
    //
    // LOOM DIALECT (cfg(loom) arms): loom 0.7 does not model the single
    // total order of SeqCst operations/fences — it admits the store-buffer
    // miss-miss outcome the C++ model forbids (PROVEN by
    // waiter/tests/loom_litmus.rs, which fails the day loom gains real SC
    // support). Fence-disciplined plain READS therefore become RMW reads
    // under loom ONLY (loom binds RMWs to the latest value in modification
    // order — exactly the recency the fences guarantee on real hardware, at
    // equal-or-stronger ordering); each read edge's RMW carries the adjacent
    // pg_memory_barrier()'s strength, and demoting one to its native text
    // models OMITTING that C barrier — the latch loom models must then fail
    // (the lane's red battery, worklog table).
    //
    // THE DIALECT LAW (LATCH-LOOM fidelity finding, red-battery R2):
    //   * READ edges  -> `fetch_add(0, SeqCst)`: an un-stale read (RMW reads
    //     the modification-order latest) with an acquire side that pairs
    //     with the write edge's release.
    //   * WRITE edges -> `swap(_, Release)`: an UN-BUFFERABLE write (loom
    //     may order a plain store after later RMWs in modification order —
    //     the litmus weakness restated — so a plain-store write edge
    //     readmits the miss-miss deadlock) whose RELAXED READ SIDE ACQUIRES
    //     NOTHING. That last property is load-bearing for model teeth: an
    //     RMW read also inserts a phantom write into the cell's history, and
    //     a SeqCst swap on a write edge acquire-chains through the OTHER
    //     side's phantom recheck-writes, causally publishing unrelated prior
    //     state. Concretely: with mark_set as a SeqCst swap, the setter
    //     chained waker-word visibility through the WAITER's own post-arm
    //     is_set recheck (phantom write -> swap acquire-read), and the
    //     publish-after-arm lost-wake red passed silently — a hidden bug
    //     class. Release-swap write edges close exactly that hole.
    //   * The one SeqCst RMW WRITE is reset_clear_is_set (see its doc — its
    //     acquire-read of the probe's phantom write IS the dialect's
    //     rendering of the fence-to-fence edge in the reset race).
    //   * FENCES: the protocol's pg_memory_barrier() calls ride
    //     [`pg_memory_barrier`] below — real fence(SeqCst) native/sim,
    //     NO-OP under loom. Two reasons, both proven in the lane's red
    //     battery: (1) loom's SC-op total order is disabled (loom
    //     rt/thread.rs seq_cst(): "as a quick fix, just disable it"), so a
    //     fence buys no SC ordering anyway — the RMW edges carry each
    //     barrier's strength; (2) loom's fence(SeqCst) IS an
    //     acquire-everything-seen fence (rt/atomic.rs fence_acq), which
    //     upgrades the write-edge swaps' RELAXED phantom reads into acquire
    //     syncs — with the fence live under loom, the setter acquire-chained
    //     the WAITER's post-arm recheck clock through mark_set's phantom
    //     read and the publish-after-arm red (R2) passed silently.
    //
    // Precedent: the latch-over-Waiter mirror in waiter/tests/loom.rs used
    // the coarser all-SeqCst-RMW translation (kept frozen there,
    // superseded — it carries the phantom-chain over-synchronization the
    // law above names); these methods move the refined dialect into the
    // production type so the models drive the REAL wait/set paths.
